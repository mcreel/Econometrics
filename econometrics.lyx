\begin_layout Section
Prerequisites
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These notes have been prepared under the assumption that the reader understands
 basic statistics, linear algebra, and mathematical optimization.
 There are many sources for this material, one are the appendices to 
\emph on
Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach
\emph default
 by Jeffrey Wooldridge.
 It is the student's responsibility to get up to speed on this material,
 it will not be covered in class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document integrates lecture notes for a one year graduate level course
 with computer programs that illustrate and apply the methods that are studied.
 The immediate availability of executable (and modifiable) example programs
 when using the PDF version of the document is a distinguishing feature
 of these notes.
 If printed, the document is a somewhat terse approximation to a textbook.
 These notes are not intended to be a perfect substitute for a printed textbook.
 If you are a student of mine, please note that last sentence carefully.
 There are many good textbooks available.
 Students taking my courses should read the appropriate sections from at
 least one of the following books (or other textbooks with similar level
 and content)

Contents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With respect to contents, the emphasis is on estimation and inference within
 the world of stationary data.
 If you take a moment to read the licensing information in the next section,
 you'll see that you are free to copy and modify the document.
 If anyone would like to contribute material that expands the contents,
 it would be very welcome.
 Error corrections and other additions are also welcome.

\begin_inset CommandInset href

) are an important part of these notes.
 Julia

\backslash
htmladdnormallink{(julialang.org)}{https://julialang.org}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 has been used for most of the example programs, which are scattered though
 the document.
 The examples and code use the current stable version of Julia, version
 1.x.
 This choice is motivated by several factors.
 Julia runs on all of the popular operating systems, it is free, and it
 is fast, thanks to just-in-time compilation.
 It is a relatively new language, but is already quite stable.
 The fundamental tools (manipulation of matrices, statistical functions,
 minimization, 
\emph on
etc.
\emph default
) exist and are implemented in a way that make extending them fairly easy,
 plus new packages for more advanced applications are appearing constantly.

 See the README.md file on the web page.you need to install Julia and then
 install this repository as a Julia package.
 Do this as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
add the package to Julia by doing 
\family typewriter
] add <path where you downloaded the repo>
\family default

 you would do 
\family typewriter
] add ~/git/Econometrics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
then do

\begin_layout Section
Why Julia?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
free: free in terms of $$$, and also, source code is free, so you can know
 exactly what it does, and you can modify it and contribute to it
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
multi-platform: runs on all the popular operating systems.
 For teaching econometrics, this is nice, because all students have equal
 access to the materials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
fast: speed of well-written code is close to C or Fortan.
 Code is relatively easy to write and to read, similar to Matlab or other
 matrix scripting languages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the above 3 considerations are essentially necessary for a language for
 modern science, which requires accessibility, verifiability, and performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
also, it's fun: the ecosystem is still developing rapidly, plenty of room
 to contribute

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Why not Julia?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Julia code is compiled before it's run.
 This means that first calls to functions take a bit of time, as they are
 compiled.
 The second call will be much faster-Interactive use may frustrate quite
 a bit, at least until you learn to work around this particularity.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
this will get better over time, as support for pre-compilation improves
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
can be dealt with quite easily by warming up functions with toy usages,
 which you might include in your startup file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Also, keep your Julia session running, and the things you use often will
 already be compiled from previous uses.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
the speed is only needed if your work is computationally demanding.
 Dividing epsilon by 2 is not very important when epsilon is small.
 For getting fast results for linear models, you may prefer a more complete
 canned package, e.g., Stata, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the ecosystem is still developing, some features like DataFrames and plotting
 are not as complete or stable as in other languages.
 However, I have been using it happily since 2014, and have been getting
 work done.
 
\strikeout on
Once the 1.0 release is out, 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

real soon now
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

, things will stabilize
\strikeout default
 Strike that! Julia 1.0 was released in August 2018.
 The basic language is now quite stable, though packages are still developing
 at a quick rate.

Economic theory tells us that the quantity of a good that consumers will

The supply of the good to the market is the aggregation of the firms' supply

 The market supply function is something like

Theory can make some predictions, too.

Given that we know the variable names of the above data, estimate the supply
 equation by two stage least squares, if you know how to.
 Compare the coefficient estimates with the values that generated the data.
 Note that the estimates are not bad, and get very close to the true values
 if you increase the sample size.
 This is because the model is correctly specified, and the 2SLS estimator
 is consistent in this case.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $X\hat{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is the projection of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 onto the span of 
\begin_inset Formula $X,$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X\hat{\beta}=X\left(X^{\prime}X\right)^{-1}X^{\prime}y
\]

\end_inset

 Therefore, the matrix

matrix, projection
\end_layout

\end_inset

 that projects 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 onto the span of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{X}=X(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}
\]

\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X\hat{\beta}=P_{X}y.
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 is the projection of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 onto the 
\begin_inset Formula $N-K$
\end_inset

 dimensional space that is orthogonal to the span of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 We have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\varepsilon} & = & y-X\hat{\beta}\\
 & = & y-X(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}y\\
 & = & \left[I_{n}-X(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\right]y.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 So the matrix that projects 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 onto the space orthogonal to the span of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
M_{X} & = & I_{n}-X(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\\
 & = & I_{n}-P_{X}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 We have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\varepsilon}=M_{X}y.
\]

\end_inset

Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y & = & P_{X}y+M_{X}y\\
 & = & X\hat{\beta}+\hat{\varepsilon}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

These two projection matrices decompose the

This is how we define a linear estimator
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
estimator, linear
\end_layout

\end_inset

 - it's a linear function of the dependent variable.
 Since it's a linear combination of the observations on the dependent variable,
 where the weights are determined by the observations on the regressors,
 some observations may have more influence than others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To investigate this, let 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{t}$
\end_inset

 be an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 vector of zeros with a 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 in the t
\begin_inset Formula $^{th}$
\end_inset

 position, 
\emph on
i.e.,
\emph default
 it's the 
\begin_inset Formula $t\textrm{th column of the matrix \ensuremath{I_{n}}}$
\end_inset

.
 Define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
h_{t} & = & \left(P_{X}\right)_{tt}\\
 & = & e_{t}^{\prime}P_{X}e_{t}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the t
\begin_inset Formula $^{th}$
\end_inset

 element on the main diagonal of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{X}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
h_{t} & = & \parallel P_{X}e_{t}\parallel^{2}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{t}\leq\parallel e_{t}\parallel^{2}=1
\]

\end_inset

So 
\begin_inset Formula $0<h_{t}<1$
\end_inset

.
 Also, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
TrP_{X}=K\Rightarrow\overline{h}=K/n.
\]

\end_inset

So the average of the 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{t}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $K/n$
\end_inset

.
 The value 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{t}$
\end_inset

 is referred to as the 
\emph on
leverage
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
leverage
\end_layout

\end_inset


\emph default
 of the observation.
 If the leverage is much higher than average, the observation has the potential
 to affect the OLS fit importantly.
 However, an observation may also be influential due to the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

, rather than the weight it is multiplied by, which only depends on the
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

's.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To account for this, consider estimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 without using the 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{th}$
\end_inset

 observation (designate this estimator as 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}^{(t)}).$
\end_inset

 One can show (see Davidson and MacKinnon, pp.
 32-5 for proof) that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\beta}^{(t)}=\hat{\beta}-\left(\frac{1}{1-h_{t}}\right)(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X_{t}^{\prime}\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 so the change in the 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{th}$
\end_inset

 observations fitted value is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\prime}\hat{\beta}-\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\prime}\hat{\beta}^{(t)}=\left(\frac{h_{t}}{1-h_{t}}\right)\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 While an observation may be influential if it doesn't affect its own fitted
 value, it certainly 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 influential if it does.
 A fast means of identifying influential observations is to plot 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\frac{h_{t}}{1-h_{t}}\right)\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}$
\end_inset

 (which I will refer to as the

Normality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the linearity assumption, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}=\beta+(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\varepsilon.$
\end_inset

 This is a linear function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

.
 Adding the assumption of normality (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "assumption: normal errors"

\end_inset

, which implies strong exogeneity), then
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\beta}\sim N\left(\beta,(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}\sigma_{0}^{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

since a linear function of a normal random vector is also normally distributed.
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "figure-unbiasedness"

\end_inset

 you can see that the estimator appears to be normally distributed.
 It in fact is normally distributed, since the DGP (see the Octave program)
 has normal errors.
 Even when the data may be taken to be IID, the assumption of normality
 is often questionable or simply untenable.
 For example, if the dependent variable is the number of automobile trips
 per week, it is a count variable with a discrete distribution, and is thus
 not normally distributed.
 Many variables in economics can take on only nonnegative values, which,
 strictly speaking, rules out normality.

Normality may be a good model nonetheless, as long as the probability of
 a negative value occurring is negligible under the model.
 This depends upon the mean being large enough in relation to the variance.

Now let's make all the classical assumptions except the assumption of normality.
 We have 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}=\beta+(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $E(\hat{\beta})=\beta$
\end_inset

.
 So
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Var(\hat{\beta}) & = & E\left\{ \left(\mathbf{\hat{\beta}-\beta}\right)\left(\mathbf{\hat{\beta}-\beta}\right)^{\prime}\right\} \\
 & = & E\left\{ (X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\varepsilon\varepsilon^{\prime}X(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}\right\} \\

\begin_inset Formula $C$

 It is also

 under the present assumptions, as we proved above.
 One could consider other weights 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 that are a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 that define some other linear estimator.
 We'll still insist upon unbiasedness.
 Consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\beta}=Wy,$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $W=W(X)$
\end_inset

 is some 
\begin_inset Formula $k\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix function of 
\begin_inset Formula $X.$
\end_inset

 Note that since 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $X,$
\end_inset

 it is nonstochastic, too.
 If the estimator is unbiased, then we must have 
\begin_inset Formula $WX=I_{K}$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{E}(Wy) & = & \mathcal{E}(WX\beta_{0}+W\varepsilon)\\
 & = & WX\beta_{0}\\
 & = & \beta_{0}\\
 & \Rightarrow\\
WX & = & I_{K}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 The variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V(\tilde{\beta})=WW^{\prime}\sigma_{0}^{2}.
\]

\end_inset

 Define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D=W-(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}
\]

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W=D+(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}
\]

\end_inset

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $WX=I_{K},$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $DX=0,$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
V(\tilde{\beta}) & = & \left(D+(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\right)\left(D+(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\right)^{\prime}\sigma_{0}^{2}\\
 & = & \left(DD^{\prime}+\left(X^{\prime}X\right)^{-1}\right)\sigma_{0}^{2}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 So 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V(\tilde{\beta})\geq V(\hat{\beta})
\]

\end_inset

 The inequality is a shorthand means of expressing, more formally, that
 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\tilde{\beta})-V(\hat{\beta})$
\end_inset

 is a positive semi-definite matrix.
 This is a proof of the Gauss-Markov Theorem.
 The OLS estimator is the

It is worth emphasizing again that we have not used the normality assumption
 in any way to prove the Gauss-Markov theorem, so it is valid if the errors
 are not normally distributed, as long as the other assumptions hold.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate the Gauss-Markov result, consider the estimator that results
 from splitting the sample into 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 equally-sized parts, estimating using each part of the data separately
 by OLS, then averaging the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 resulting estimators.
 You should be able to show that this estimator is unbiased, but inefficient
 with respect to the OLS estimator.

 is 
\begin_inset Formula

 & = & \sigma_{0}^{2}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where we use the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $Tr(AB)=Tr(BA)$
\end_inset

 when both products are conformable.
 Thus, this estimator is also unbiased under these assumptions.

\begin_layout Standard
For a firm that takes input prices

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(x)=q.
\]

\end_inset

 The solution is the vector of factor demands 
\begin_inset Formula $x(w,q)$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\emph on
cost function
\emph default
 is obtained by substituting the factor demands into the criterion function:

 Lemma).
\end_layout

\begin_inset Formula $C(tw,q)=tC(w,q)$
\end_inset

 is a scalar constant.
 This is because the factor demands are homogeneous of degree zero in factor
 prices - they only depend upon relative prices.

\]

\end_inset


\emph on
Constant returns to scale

\begin_layout Subsection
Cobb-Douglas functional form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Cobb-Douglas functional form is linear in the logarithms of the regressors
 and the dependent variable.
 For a cost function, if there are 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 factors, the Cobb-Douglas cost function has the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C=Aw_{1}^{\beta_{1}}...w_{g}^{\beta_{g}}q^{\beta_{q}}e^{\varepsilon}
\]

\end_inset

What is the elasticity of 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{j}$
\end_inset

?
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
e_{w_{j}}^{C} & = & \left(\frac{\partial C}{\partial_{W_{J}}}\right)\left(\frac{w_{j}}{C}\right)\\
 & = & \beta_{j}Aw_{1}^{\beta_{1}}.w_{j}^{\beta_{j}-1}..w_{g}^{\beta_{g}}q^{\beta_{q}}e^{\varepsilon}\frac{w_{j}}{Aw_{1}^{\beta_{1}}...w_{g}^{\beta_{g}}q^{\beta_{q}}e^{\varepsilon}}\\
 & = & \beta_{j}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

This is one of the reasons the Cobb-Douglas form is popular - the coefficients
 are easy to interpret, since they are the elasticities of the dependent
 variable with respect to the explanatory variable.
 Not that in this case,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
e_{w_{j}}^{C} & = & \left(\frac{\partial C}{\partial_{W_{J}}}\right)\left(\frac{w_{j}}{C}\right)\\
 & = & x_{j}(w,q)\frac{w_{j}}{C}\\
 & \equiv & s_{j}(w,q)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

the 
\emph on
cost share
\emph default
 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $j^{th}$
\end_inset

 input.
 So with a Cobb-Douglas cost function, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{j}=s_{j}(w,q)$
\end_inset

.
 The cost shares are constants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that after a logarithmic transformation we obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ln C=\alpha+\beta_{1}\ln w_{1}+...+\beta_{g}\ln w_{g}+\beta_{q}\ln q+\epsilon
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\ln A$
\end_inset

 .
 So we see that the transformed model is linear in the logs of the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can verify that the property of HOD1 implies that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{g}\beta_{i}=1
\]

\end_inset

In other words, the cost shares add up to 1.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hypothesis that the technology exhibits CRTS implies that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma=\frac{1}{\beta_{q}}=1
\]

\end_inset

so 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{q}=1.$
\end_inset

 Likewise, monotonicity implies that the coefficients

For application of LLN's and CLT's, of which there are very many to choose
 from, I'm going to avoid the technicalities.
 Basically, as long as terms that make up an average have finite variances
 and are not too strongly dependent, one will be able to find a LLN or CLT
 to apply.
 Which one it is doesn't matter, we only need the result.
 When working with particular models, it will be more relevant to consider
 which particular theorems will apply.

\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\beta}-\beta_{0}\right) & = & \left(\frac{X^{\prime}X}{n}\right)^{-1}\frac{X^{\prime}\varepsilon}{\sqrt{n}}

 the limit of the variance is

\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 The mean is of course zero.
 To get asymptotic normality, we need to apply a CLT.
 The best known CLTs are for averages of IID terms, but CLTs exist for averages
 of dependent, non-identically distributed terms, too.
 The basic requirement is that variances of the terms in the average must
 not explode, and the terms in the average can not be too highly dependent.
 Without getting into the technical details, which are appropriate to discuss
 when working with some particular type of data, we assume one holds, so
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{X^{\prime}\varepsilon}{\sqrt{n}}\overset{d}{\rightarrow}N\left(0,\sigma_{0}^{2}Q_{X}\right)
\]

\end_inset

 Therefore,

 The joint density for

 can be constructed using a change of variables.

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial\varepsilon}{\partial y^{\prime}}=I_{n}$

\end_inset

 Maximizing this function with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$

 gives what is known as the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator.
 It turns out that ML estimators are asymptotically efficient, a concept
 that will be explained in detail later.
 It's clear that the first order conditions for the MLE of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}$
\end_inset

 are the same as the first order conditions that define the OLS estimator
 (up to multiplication by a constant), so the OLS estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

 is also the ML estimator.

As we'll see later, it will be possible to use (iterated) linear estimation

Exact linear restrictions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many cases, economic theory suggests restrictions on the parameters of
 a model.
 For example, a demand function is supposed to be homogeneous of degree
 zero in prices and income.
 If we have a Cobb-Douglas (log-linear) model, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ln q=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\ln p_{1}+\beta_{2}\ln p_{2}+\beta_{3}\ln m+\varepsilon,
\]

\end_inset

 then we need that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k^{0}\ln q=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\ln kp_{1}+\beta_{2}\ln kp_{2}+\beta_{3}\ln km+\varepsilon,
\]

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\beta_{1}\ln p_{1}+\beta_{2}\ln p_{2}+\beta_{3}\ln m & = & \beta_{1}\ln kp_{1}+\beta_{2}\ln kp_{2}+\beta_{3}\ln km\\
 & = & \left(\ln k\right)(\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}+\beta_{3})+\beta_{1}\ln p_{1}+\beta_{2}\ln p_{2}+\beta_{3}\ln m.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 The only way to guarantee this for arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is to set 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}+\beta_{3}=0,
\]

\end_inset

 which is a 
\emph on

 In particular, this is a linear equality restriction, which is probably
 the most commonly encountered case.

\begin_inset Formula $R$

\begin_inset Formula $Q<K$

\begin_layout Standard
Let's consider how to estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 subject to the restrictions 
\begin_inset Formula $R\beta=r.$
\end_inset

 The most obvious approach is to set up the Lagrangean 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\min_{\beta,\lambda}s(\beta,\lambda)=\frac{1}{n}\left(y-X\beta\right)^{\prime}\left(y-X\beta\right)+2\lambda^{\prime}(R\beta-r).
\]

\end_inset

 The Lagrange multipliers are scaled by 2, which makes things less messy.
 The fonc are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
D_{\beta}s(\hat{\beta},\hat{\lambda}) & = & -2X^{\prime}y+2X^{\prime}X\hat{\beta}_{R}+2R^{\prime}\hat{\lambda}\equiv0\\
D_{\lambda}s(\hat{\beta},\hat{\lambda}) & = & R\hat{\beta}_{R}-r\equiv0,
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 which can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
X^{\prime}X & R^{\prime}\\
R & 0
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\hat{\beta}_{R}\\
\hat{\lambda}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
X^{\prime}y\\
r
\end{array}\right].
\]

\end_inset

 We get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\hat{\beta}_{R}\\
\hat{\lambda}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
X^{\prime}X & R^{\prime}\\
R & 0
\end{array}\right]^{-1}\left[\begin{array}{c}
X^{\prime}y\\

\begin_inset Formula $Q\times Q$

 Supposing the

 Then 
\begin_inset Formula

y_{R}=X_{R}\beta_{2}+\varepsilon.

\end_inset

 This model satisfies the classical assumptions,

supposing the restriction is true
\emph default
.
 One can estimate by OLS.
 The variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}_{2}$

 is as before 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V(\hat{\beta}_{2})=\left(X_{R}^{\prime}X_{R}\right)^{-1}\sigma_{0}^{2}

 and the estimator is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{V}(\hat{\beta}_{2})=\left(X_{R}^{\prime}X_{R}\right)^{-1}\hat{\sigma}^{2}

 To recover 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}_{1},$

 use the restriction.
 To find the variance of

 use the fact that it is a linear function of

 Mean squared error is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MSE(\hat{\beta}_{R})=\mathcal{E}(\hat{\beta}_{R}-\beta)(\hat{\beta}_{R}-\beta)^{\prime}

\end_inset

 Noting that the crosses between the second term and the other terms expect
 to zero, and that the cross of the first and third has a cancellation with
 the square of the third, we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
MSE(\hat{\beta}_{R}) & = & (X^{\prime}X)^{-1}\sigma^{2}\\

 The third and fourth (Wald and score) do not require normality of the errors,
 but their distributions are known only approximately, so that they are
 not exactly valid with finite samples.

The Wald principle is based on the idea that if a restriction is true, the

 satisfy the restriction.
 Given that the least squares estimator is asymptotically normally distributed:
 
\begin_inset Formula

\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\beta}-\beta_{0}\right)\overset{d}{\rightarrow}N\left(0,\sigma_{0}^{2}Q_{X}^{-1}\right)

\begin_inset Formula

 Note that

\begin_layout Standard
The score test is another asymptotically valid test that does not require

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some cases, an unrestricted model may be nonlinear in the parameters,
 but the model is linear in the parameters under the null hypothesis.
 For example, the model 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y=\left(X\beta\right)^{\gamma}+\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset

 is nonlinear in 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma,$
\end_inset

 but is linear in 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 under 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}:\gamma=1.$
\end_inset

 Estimation of nonlinear models is a bit more complicated, so one might
 prefer to have a test based upon the restricted, linear model.
 The score test is useful in this situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Score-type tests are based upon the general principle that the gradient
 vector of the unrestricted model, evaluated at the restricted estimate,
 should be asymptotically normally distributed with mean zero, if the restrictio

\begin_layout Standard
We have seen that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\lambda} & = & \left(R(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}R^{\prime}\right)^{-1}\left(R\hat{\beta}-r\right)\\
 & = & P^{-1}\left(R\hat{\beta}-r\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

so
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}\hat{P\lambda}=\sqrt{n}\left(R\hat{\beta}-r\right)
\]

\end_inset

Given that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}\left(R\hat{\beta}-r\right)\overset{d}{\rightarrow}N\left(0,\sigma_{0}^{2}RQ_{X}^{-1}R^{\prime}\right)
\]

\end_inset

 under the null hypothesis, we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}\hat{P\lambda}\overset{d}{\rightarrow}N\left(0,\sigma_{0}^{2}RQ_{X}^{-1}R^{\prime}\right)
\]

\end_inset

 So
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\sqrt{n}\hat{P\lambda}\right)^{\prime}\left(\sigma_{0}^{2}RQ_{X}^{-1}R^{\prime}\right)^{-1}\left(\sqrt{n}\hat{P\lambda}\right)\overset{d}{\rightarrow}\chi^{2}(q)
\]

\end_inset

Noting that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim nP=RQ_{X}^{-1}R^{\prime},$
\end_inset

 we obtain, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\lambda}^{\prime}\left(\frac{R(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}R^{\prime}}{\sigma_{0}^{2}}\right)\hat{\lambda}\overset{d}{\rightarrow}\chi^{2}(q)
\]

\end_inset

 since the powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 cancel.
 To get a usable test statistic substitute a consistent estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}^{2}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This makes it clear why the test is sometimes referred to as a Lagrange
 multiplier test.
 It may seem that one needs the actual Lagrange multipliers to calculate
 this.
 If we impose the restrictions by substitution, these are not available.
 Note that the test can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\left(R^{\prime}\hat{\lambda}\right)^{\prime}(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}R^{\prime}\hat{\lambda}}{\sigma_{0}^{2}}\overset{d}{\rightarrow}\chi^{2}(q)
\]

\end_inset

 However, we can use the fonc for the restricted estimator: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-X^{\prime}y+X^{\prime}X\hat{\beta}_{R}+R^{\prime}\hat{\lambda}
\]

\end_inset

 to get that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
R^{\prime}\hat{\lambda} & = & X^{\prime}(y-X\hat{\beta}_{R})\\
 & = & X^{\prime}\hat{\varepsilon}_{R}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 Substituting this into the above, we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\hat{\varepsilon}_{R}^{\prime}X(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\hat{\varepsilon}_{R}}{\sigma_{0}^{2}}\overset{d}{\rightarrow}\chi^{2}(q)
\]

\end_inset

 but this is simply 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\varepsilon}_{R}^{\prime}\frac{P_{X}}{\sigma_{0}^{2}}\hat{\varepsilon}_{R}\overset{d}{\rightarrow}\chi^{2}(q).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see why the test is also known as a score test, note that the fonc for
 restricted least squares 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-X^{\prime}y+X^{\prime}X\hat{\beta}_{R}+R^{\prime}\hat{\lambda}
\]

\end_inset

 give us 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R^{\prime}\hat{\lambda}=X^{\prime}y-X^{\prime}X\hat{\beta}_{R}
\]

\end_inset

 and the rhs is simply the gradient (score)

of the unrestricted model, evaluated at the restricted estimator.
 The scores evaluated at the unrestricted estimate are identically zero.
 The logic behind the score test is that the scores evaluated at the restricted
 estimate should be approximately zero, if the restriction is true.
 The test is also known as a Rao test, since P.
 Rao first proposed it in 1948.

 In fact, they all converge to the

 rv, under the null hypothesis.
 We'll show that the Wald and LR tests are asymptotically equivalent.
 We have seen that the Wald test is asymptotically equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Using 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\beta}-\beta_{0}=(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R\hat{\beta}-r=R(\hat{\beta}-\beta_{0})
\]

\end_inset

 we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sqrt{n}R(\hat{\beta}-\beta_{0}) & = & \sqrt{n}R(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\varepsilon\\
 & = & R\left(\frac{X^{\prime}X}{n}\right)^{-1}n^{-1/2}X^{\prime}\varepsilon
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 Substitute this into [
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:Wald"

\end_inset

] to get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
W & \overset{a}{=} & n^{-1}\varepsilon^{\prime}XQ_{X}^{-1}R^{\prime}\left(\sigma_{0}^{2}RQ_{X}^{-1}R^{\prime}\right)^{-1}RQ_{X}^{-1}X^{\prime}\varepsilon\\

 & \overset{a}{=} & \frac{\varepsilon^{\prime}A(A^{\prime}A)^{-1}A^{\prime}\varepsilon}{\sigma_{0}^{2}}\\
 & \overset{a}{=} & \frac{\varepsilon^{\prime}P_{R}\varepsilon}{\sigma_{0}^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{R}$

 is the projection matrix formed by the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $X(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}R^{\prime}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Standard
Now consider the likelihood ratio statistic 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
LR\overset{a}{=}n^{1/2}g(\theta_{0})^{\prime}\mathcal{I}(\theta_{0})^{-1}R^{\prime}\left(R\mathcal{I}(\theta_{0})^{-1}R^{\prime}\right)^{-1}R\mathcal{I}(\theta_{0})^{-1}n^{1/2}g(\theta_{0})\label{eq:LR}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Under normality, we have seen that the likelihood function is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ln L(\beta,\sigma)=-n\ln\sqrt{2\pi}-n\ln\sigma-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\left(y-X\beta\right)^{\prime}\left(y-X\beta\right)}{\sigma^{2}}.
\]

\end_inset

 Using this, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
g(\beta_{0}) & \equiv & D_{\beta}\frac{1}{n}\ln L(\beta,\sigma)\\
 & = & \frac{X^{\prime}(y-X\beta_{0})}{n\sigma^{2}}\\
 & = & \frac{X^{\prime}\varepsilon}{n\sigma^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 Also, by the information matrix equality: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{I}(\theta_{0}) & = & -H_{\infty}(\theta_{0})\\
 & = & \lim-D_{\beta^{\prime}}g(\beta_{0})\\
 & = & \lim-D_{\beta^{\prime}}\frac{X^{\prime}(y-X\beta_{0})}{n\sigma^{2}}\\
 & = & \lim\frac{X^{\prime}X}{n\sigma^{2}}\\
 & = & \frac{Q_{X}}{\sigma^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{I}(\theta_{0})^{-1}=\sigma^{2}Q_{X}^{-1}
\]

\end_inset

 Substituting these last expressions into [
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:LR"

\end_inset

], we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
LR & \overset{a}{=} & \varepsilon^{\prime}X^{\prime}(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}R^{\prime}\left(\sigma_{0}^{2}R(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}R^{\prime}\right)^{-1}R(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\varepsilon\\
 & \overset{a}{=} & \frac{\varepsilon^{\prime}P_{R}\varepsilon}{\sigma_{0}^{2}}\\
 & \overset{a}{=} & W
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 This completes the proof that the Wald and LR tests are asymptotically
 equivalent.
 Similarly, one can show that,

 The numeric values of the tests also depend upon how

 this.

\begin_layout Standard
It can be shown, for linear regression models subject to linear restrictions,

\end_inset

 is used for the score test, that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W>LR>LM.

\end_inset

 For this reason, the Wald test will always reject if the LR test rejects,
 and in turn the LR test rejects if the LM test rejects.
 This is a bit problematic:

there is the possibility that by careful choice of the statistic used, one
 can manipulate reported results to favor or disfavor a hypothesis.
 A conservative/honest approach would be to report all three test statistics
 when they are available.
 In the case of linear models with normal errors the 
\begin_inset Formula $F\;$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The small sample behavior of the tests can be quite different.
 The true size (probability of rejection of the null when the null is true)
 of the Wald test is often dramatically higher than the nominal size associated
 with the asymptotic distribution.
 Likewise, the true size of the score test is often smaller than the nominal
 size.

Bootstrapping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we rely on asymptotic theory to use the normal distribution-based tests
 and confidence intervals, we're often at serious risk of making important
 errors.
 If the sample size is small and errors are highly nonnormal, the small
 sample distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\beta}-\beta_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 may be very different from its large sample distribution.
 Also, the distributions of test statistics may not resemble their limiting
 distributions at all.
 A means of trying to gain information on the small sample distribution
 of test statistics and estimators is the 
\emph on
bootstrap.

\emph default
 We'll consider a simple example, just to get the main idea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y & = & X\beta_{0}+\varepsilon\\
\varepsilon & \sim & IID(0,\sigma_{0}^{2})\\
 & X\textrm{ is nonstochastic}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 Given that the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 is unknown, the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}$
\end_inset

 will be unknown in small samples.
 However, since we have random sampling, we could generate 
\emph on
artificial data.

\emph default
 The steps are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Draw 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 observations from 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 
\series bold
with replacement
\series default
.
 Call this vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\varepsilon}^{j}$
\end_inset

 (it's a 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times1).$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Then generate the data by 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{y}^{j}=X\hat{\beta}+\tilde{\varepsilon}^{j}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now take this and estimate 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{\beta}^{j}=(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\tilde{y}^{j}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Save 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\beta}^{j}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Repeat steps 1-4, until we have a large number, 
\begin_inset Formula $J,$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\beta}^{j}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With this, we can use the replications to calculate the 
\emph on
empirical distribution of
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\beta}_{j}.$
\end_inset

 One way to form a 100(1-
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha)\%$
\end_inset

 confidence interval for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}$
\end_inset

 would be to order the 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\beta}^{j}$
\end_inset

 from smallest to largest, and drop the first and last 
\begin_inset Formula $J\alpha/2$
\end_inset

 of the replications, and use the remaining endpoints as the limits of the
 CI.
 Note that this will not give the shortest CI if the empirical distribution
 is skewed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Suppose one was interested in the distribution of some function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta},$
\end_inset

 for example a test statistic.
 Simple: just calculate the transformation for each 
\begin_inset Formula $j,$
\end_inset

 and work with the empirical distribution of the transformation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the assumption of iid errors is too strong (for example if there is heterosce
dasticity or autocorrelation, see below) one can work with a bootstrap defined
 by sampling from 
\begin_inset Formula $(y,x)$
\end_inset

 with replacement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How to choose 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 should be large enough that the results don't change with repetition of
 the entire bootstrap.
 This is easy to check.
 If you find the results change a lot, increase 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 and try again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The bootstrap is based fundamentally on the idea that the empirical distribution
 of the sample data converges to the actual sampling distribution as 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 becomes large, so statistics based on sampling from the empirical distribution
 should converge in distribution to statistics based on sampling from the
 actual sampling distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In finite samples, this doesn't hold.
 At a minimum, the bootstrap is a good way to check if asymptotic theory
 results offer a decent approximation to the small sample distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Bootstrapping can be used to test hypotheses.
 Basically, use the bootstrap to get an approximation to the empirical distribut
ion of the test statistic under the alternative hypothesis, and use this
 to get critical values.
 Compare the test statistic calculated using the real data, under the null,
 to the bootstrap critical values.
 There are many variations on this theme, which we won't go into here.

\begin_layout Section
Wald test for nonlinear restrictions: the delta method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Testing nonlinear restrictions of a linear model is not much more difficult,
 at least when the model is linear.
 Since estimation subject to nonlinear restrictions requires nonlinear estimatio
n methods, which are beyond the score of this course, we'll just consider
 the Wald test for nonlinear restrictions on a linear model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 nonlinear restrictions 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r(\beta_{0})=0.
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $r(\cdot)\;$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

-vector valued function.
 Write the derivative of the restriction evaluated at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left.D_{\beta^{\prime}}r(\beta)\right|_{\beta}=R(\beta)
\]

\end_inset

 We suppose that the restrictions are not redundant in a neighborhood of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho(R(\beta))=q
\]

\end_inset

 in a neighborhood of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}.$
\end_inset

 Take a first order Taylor's series expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $r(\hat{\beta})$
\end_inset

 about 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r(\hat{\beta})=r(\beta_{0})+R(\beta^{*})(\hat{\beta}-\beta_{0})
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{*}$
\end_inset

 is a convex combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}.$
\end_inset

 Under the null hypothesis we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r(\hat{\beta})=R(\beta^{*})(\hat{\beta}-\beta_{0})
\]

\end_inset

 Due to consistency of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}$
\end_inset

 we can replace 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{*}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}$
\end_inset

, asymptotically, so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}r(\hat{\beta})\overset{a}{=}\sqrt{n}R(\beta_{0})(\hat{\beta}-\beta_{0})
\]

\end_inset

 We've already seen the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}(\hat{\beta}-\beta_{0}).$
\end_inset

 Using this we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}r(\hat{\beta})\overset{d}{\rightarrow}N\left(0,R(\beta_{0})Q_{X}^{-1}R(\beta_{0})^{\prime}\sigma_{0}^{2}\right).
\]

\end_inset

 Considering the quadratic form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{nr(\hat{\beta})^{\prime}\left(R(\beta_{0})Q_{X}^{-1}R(\beta_{0})^{\prime}\right)^{-1}r(\hat{\beta})}{\sigma_{0}^{2}}\overset{d}{\rightarrow}\chi^{2}(q)
\]

\end_inset

 under the null hypothesis.
 Substituting consistent estimators for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0,}Q_{X}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}^{2},$
\end_inset

 the resulting statistic is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{r(\hat{\beta})^{\prime}\left(R(\hat{\beta})(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}R(\hat{\beta})^{\prime}\right)^{-1}r(\hat{\beta})}{\widehat{\sigma^{2}}}\overset{d}{\rightarrow}\chi^{2}(q)
\]

\end_inset

 under the null hypothesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This is known in the literature as the 
\emph on
delta method
\emph default
, or as 
\emph on
Klein's approximation
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Since this is a Wald test, it will tend to over-reject in finite samples.
 The score and LR tests are also possibilities, but they require estimation
 methods for nonlinear models, which aren't in the scope of this course.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that this also gives a convenient way to estimate nonlinear functions
 and associated asymptotic confidence intervals.
 If the nonlinear function 
\begin_inset Formula $r(\beta_{0})$
\end_inset

 is not hypothesized to be zero, we just have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}\left(r(\hat{\beta})-r(\beta_{0})\right)\overset{d}{\rightarrow}N\left(0,R(\beta_{0})Q_{X}^{-1}R(\beta_{0})^{\prime}\sigma_{0}^{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

 so an approximation to the distribution of the function of the estimator
 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r(\hat{\beta})\approx N(r(\beta_{0}),R(\beta_{0})(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}R(\beta_{0})^{\prime}\sigma_{0}^{2})
\]

\end_inset

 For example, the vector of elasticities of a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta(x)=\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x}\odot\frac{x}{f(x)}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\odot$
\end_inset

 means element-by-element multiplication.
 Suppose we estimate a linear function 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y=x^{\prime}\beta+\varepsilon.
\]

\end_inset

 The elasticities of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 w.r.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta(x)=\frac{\beta}{x^{\prime}\beta}\odot x
\]

\end_inset

(note that this is the entire vector of elasticities).
 The estimated elasticities are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{\eta}(x)=\frac{\hat{\beta}}{x^{\prime}\hat{\beta}}\odot x
\]

\end_inset

 To calculate the estimated standard errors of all five elasticities, use
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
R(\beta) & = & \frac{\partial\eta(x)}{\partial\beta^{\prime}}\\
 & = & \frac{\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
x_{1} & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
0 & x_{2} &  & \vdots\\
\vdots &  & \ddots & 0\\
0 & \cdots & 0 & x_{k}
\end{array}\right]x'\beta-\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\beta_{1}x_{1}^{2} & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
0 & \beta_{2}x_{2}^{2} &  & \vdots\\
\vdots &  & \ddots & 0\\
0 & \cdots & 0 & \beta_{k}x_{k}^{2}
\end{array}\right]}{(x'\beta)^{2}}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

To get a consistent estimator just substitute in 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the elasticity and the standard error are functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $x.$

 shows how this can be done.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many cases, nonlinear restrictions can also involve the data, not just
 the parameters.
 For example, consider a model of expenditure shares.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x(p,m)$
\end_inset

 be a demand function, where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is prices and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is income.
 An expenditure share system for 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 goods is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{i}(p,m)=\frac{p_{i}x_{i}(p,m)}{m},i=1,2,...,G.
\]

\end_inset

 Now demand must be positive, and we assume that expenditures sum to income,
 so we have the restrictions 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
0 & \leq s_{i}(p,m)\leq1, & \forall i\\
\sum_{i=1}^{G}s_{i}(p,m) & = & 1
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 Suppose we postulate a linear model for the expenditure shares: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{i}(p,m)=\beta_{1}^{i}+p^{\prime}\beta_{p}^{i}+m\beta_{m}^{i}+\varepsilon^{i}
\]

\end_inset

 It is fairly easy to write restrictions such that the shares sum to one,
 but the restriction that the shares lie in the 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

 interval depends on both parameters and the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m.$
\end_inset

 It is impossible to impose the restriction that 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq s_{i}(p,m)\leq1$
\end_inset

 for all possible 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m.$
\end_inset

 In such cases, one might consider whether or not a linear model is a reasonable
 specification.

 Also,

 For CRTS, you should note that

 First, if we are interested in an analysis

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $X$

 are not uncorrelated, so one can't show unbiasedness.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$

 There exist a number of central limit theorems for dependent processes,

 We won't enter into details (see Hamilton, Chapter 7 if you're interested).
 A main requirement for use of standard asymptotics for a dependent sequence
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\{s_{t}\}=\{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}z_{t}\}
\]

\end_inset

 to converge in probability to a finite limit is that

 One can show that the variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$

 depends upon 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

Note how the signs of the coefficients change depending on the model, and
 that the magnitudes of the parameter estimates vary a lot, too.
 The parameter estimates are highly sensitive to the particular model we
 estimate.
 Why? We'll see that the problem is that the data exhibit 
\emph on
collinearity
\emph default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Collinearity: definition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Collinearity is the existence of linear relationships amongst the regressors.
 We can always write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda_{1}\mathbf{x}_{1}+\lambda_{2}\mathbf{x}_{2}+\cdots+\lambda_{K}\mathbf{x}_{K}+v=0
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 column of the regressor matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $X,$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 is an 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times1$
\end_inset

 vector.
 In the case that there exists collinearity, the variation in 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 is relatively small, so that there is an approximately exact linear relation
 between the regressors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

relative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

approximate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are imprecise, so it's difficult to define when collinearilty exists.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the extreme, if there are exact linear relationships (every element of
 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 equal) then 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(X)<K,$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(X^{\prime}X)<K,$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{\prime}X$
\end_inset

 is not invertible and the OLS
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

estimator is not uniquely defined.
 For example, if the model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{t} & = & \beta_{1}+\beta_{2}x_{2t}+\beta_{3}x_{3t}+\varepsilon_{t}\\
x_{2t} & = & \alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}x_{3t}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 then we can write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{t} & = & \beta_{1}+\beta_{2}\left(\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}x_{3t}\right)+\beta_{3}x_{3t}+\varepsilon_{t}\\
 & = & \beta_{1}+\beta_{2}\alpha_{1}+\beta_{2}\alpha_{2}x_{3t}+\beta_{3}x_{3t}+\varepsilon_{t}\\
 & = & \left(\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}\alpha_{1}\right)+\left(\beta_{2}\alpha_{2}+\beta_{3}\right)x_{3t}\\
 & = & \gamma_{1}+\gamma_{2}x_{3t}+\varepsilon_{t}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\prime}s$
\end_inset

 can be consistently estimated, but since the 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\prime}$
\end_inset

s define two equations in three 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{\prime}s,$
\end_inset

 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{\prime}s$
\end_inset

 can't be consistently estimated (there are multiple values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 that solve the first order conditions).
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{\prime}s$
\end_inset

 are 
\emph on
unidentified
\emph default
 in the case of perfect collinearity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Perfect collinearity is unusual, except in the case of an error in construction
 of the regressor matrix, such as including the same regressor twice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another case where perfect collinearity may be encountered is with models
 with dummy variables, if one is not careful.
 Consider a model of rental price 
\begin_inset Formula $(y_{i})$
\end_inset

 of an apartment.
 This could depend factors such as size, quality etc., collected in 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i},$
\end_inset

 as well as on the location of the apartment.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{i}=1$
\end_inset

 if the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 apartment is in Barcelona, 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{i}=0$
\end_inset

 otherwise.
 Similarly, define 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{i},$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{i}$
\end_inset

 for Girona, Tarragona and Lleida.
 One could use a model such as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{i}=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}B_{i}+\beta_{3}G_{i}+\beta_{4}T_{i}+\beta_{5}L_{i}+x_{i}^{\prime}\gamma+\varepsilon_{i}
\]

\end_inset

 In this model, 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{i}+G_{i}+T_{i}+L_{i}=1,$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall i,$
\end_inset

 so there is an exact relationship between these variables and the column
 of ones corresponding to the constant.
 One must either drop the constant, or one of the qualitative variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
A brief aside on dummy variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Dummy variable
\series default
: A dummy variable is a binary-valued variable that indicates whether or
 not some condition is true.
 It is customary to assign the value 1 if the condition is true, and 0 if
 the condition is false.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dummy variables are used essentially like any other regressor.
 Use 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 to indicate that a variable is a dummy, so that variables like 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{t2}$
\end_inset

 are understood to be dummy variables.
 Variables like 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t3}$
\end_inset

 are ordinary continuous regressors.
 You know how to interpret the following models:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}d_{t}+\epsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=\beta_{1}d_{t}+\beta_{2}(1-d_{t})+\epsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}d_{t}+\beta_{3}x_{t}+\epsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset


\series bold
Interaction terms:
\series default
 an interaction term is the product of two variables, so that the effect
 of one variable on the dependent variable depends on the value of the other.
 The following model has an interaction term.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial E(y|x)}{\partial x}=\beta_{3}+\beta_{4}d_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The slope depends on the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}d_{t}+\beta_{3}x_{t}+\beta_{4}d_{t}x_{t}+\epsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset


\series bold
Multiple dummy variables: 
\series default
we can use more than one dummy variable in a model.
 We will study models of the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}d_{t1}+\beta_{3}d_{t2}+\beta_{4}x_{t}+\epsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}d_{t1}+\beta_{3}d_{t2}+\beta_{4}d_{t1}d_{t2}+\beta_{5}x_{t}+\epsilon_{t}

Incorrect usage:

You should understand why the following models are not correct usages of
 dummy variables:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
overparameterization:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}d_{t}+\beta_{3}(1-d_{t})+\epsilon_{t}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
multiple values assigned to multiple categories.
 Suppose that we a condition that defines 4 possible categories, and we
 create a variable 
\begin_inset Formula $d=1$
\end_inset

 if the observation is in the first category, 
\begin_inset Formula $d=2$
\end_inset

 if in the second, etc.
 (This is not strictly speaking a dummy variable, according to our definition).
 Why is the following model not a good one?
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}d+\epsilon
\]

\end_inset

What is the correct way to deal with this situation?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Multiple parameterizations.
 
\series default
To formulate a model that conditions on a given set of categorical information,
 there are multiple ways to use dummy variables.
 For example, the two models 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=\beta_{1}d_{t}+\beta_{2}(1-d_{t})+\beta_{3}x_{t}+\beta_{4}d_{t}x_{t}+\epsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset

and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}d_{t}+\alpha_{3}x_{t}d_{t}+\alpha_{4}x_{t}(1-d_{t})+\epsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset

are equivalent.
 You should know what are the 4 equations that relate the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{j}$
\end_inset

 parameters to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{j}$
\end_inset

 parameters, 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,2,3,4.$
\end_inset

 You should know how to interpret the parameters of both models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Back to collinearity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The more common case, if one doesn't make mistakes such as these, is the
 existence of inexact linear relationships, 
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default
, correlations between the regressors that are less than one in absolute
 value, but not zero.
 The basic problem is that when two (or more) variables move together, it
 is difficult to determine their separate influences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Two children are in a room, along with a broken lamp.
 Both say 
\begin_inset Quotes sld

I didn't do it!
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

.
 How can we tell who broke the lamp?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lack of knowledge about the separate influences of variables is reflected
 in imprecise estimates, 
\emph on
i.e

., estimates with high variances.

With economic data, collinearity is commonly encountered, and is often a
 severe problem.
\end_layout

When there is collinearity, the minimizing point of the objective function

To see the effect of collinearity on variances, partition the regressor
 matrix as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\mathbf{x} & W\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is the first column of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 (note:
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

we can interchange the columns of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 isf we like, so there's no loss of generality in considering the first
 column).
 Now, the variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta},$
\end_inset

 under the classical assumptions, is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V(\hat{\beta})=\left(X^{\prime}X\right)^{-1}\sigma^{2}
\]

\end_inset

 Using the partition, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X^{\prime}X=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\mathbf{x} & \mathbf{x}^{\prime}W\\
W^{\prime}\mathbf{x} & W^{\prime}W
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 and following a rule for partitioned inversion, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left(X^{\prime}X\right)_{1,1}^{-1} & = & \left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}W(W^{\prime}W)^{-1}W^{\prime}\mathbf{x}\right)^{-1}\\
 & = & \left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\left(I_{n}-W(W^{\prime}W)^{^{\prime}1}W^{\prime}\right)\mathbf{x}\right)^{-1}\\
 & = & \left(ESS_{\mathbf{x}|W}\right)^{-1}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 where by 
\begin_inset Formula $ESS_{\mathbf{x}|W}$
\end_inset

 we mean the error sum of squares obtained from the regression 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{x}=W\lambda+v.
\]

\end_inset

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R^{2}=1-ESS/TSS,
\]

\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
ESS=TSS(1-R^{2})
\]

\end_inset

 so the variance of the coefficient corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V(\hat{\beta}_{\mathbf{x}})=\frac{\sigma^{2}}{TSS_{\mathbf{x}}(1-R_{\mathbf{x}|W}^{2})}\label{eq:variance factors}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 We see three factors influence the variance of this coefficient.
 It will be high if

There is a strong linear relationship between

\end_inset

 and the other regressors, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 can explain the movement in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 well.
 In this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\mathbf{x}|W}^{2}$
\end_inset

 will be close to 1.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\mathbf{x}|W}^{2}\rightarrow1,V(\hat{\beta}_{\mathbf{x}})\rightarrow\infty.$

\begin_layout Subsection
Detection of collinearity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The best way is simply to regress each explanatory variable in turn on the
 remaining regressors.
 If any of these auxiliary regressions has a high 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2},$
\end_inset

 there is a problem of collinearity.
 Furthermore, this procedure identifies which parameters are affected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sometimes, we're only interested in certain parameters.
 Collinearity isn't a problem if it doesn't affect what we're interested
 in estimating.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An alternative is to examine the matrix of correlations between the regressors.
 High correlations are sufficient but not necessary for severe collinearity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also indicative of collinearity is that the model fits well (high 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}),$
\end_inset

 but none of the variables is significantly different from zero (e.g., their
 separate influences aren't well determined).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the artificial regressions are the best approach if one wants
 to be careful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Nerlove data and collinearity.
 The simple Nerlove model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ln C=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}\ln Q+\beta_{3}\ln P_{L}+\beta_{4}\ln P_{F}+\beta_{5}\ln P_{K}+\epsilon
\]

\end_inset

When this model is estimated by OLS, some coefficients are not significant
 (see subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:The-Nerlove-data"

\end_inset

).
 Maybe this is due to collinearity? The Julia script

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Supposing that there is no more data or neglected restrictions, one possibility
 is to change perspectives, to Bayesian econometrics.
 One can express prior beliefs regarding the coefficients using stochastic
 restrictions.
 A stochastic linear restriction would be something of the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R\beta=r+v
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 are as in the case of exact linear restrictions, but 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 is a random vector.
 For example, the model could be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y & = & X\beta+\varepsilon\\
R\beta & = & r+v\\
\left(\begin{array}{c}
\varepsilon\\
v
\end{array}\right) & \sim & N\left(\begin{array}{c}
0\\
0
\end{array}\right),\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\sigma_{\varepsilon}^{2}I_{n} & 0_{n\times q}\\
0_{q\times n} & \sigma_{v}^{2}I_{q}
\end{array}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 This sort of model isn't in line with the classical interpretation of parameter
s as constants: according to this interpretation the left hand side of 
\begin_inset Formula $R\beta=r+v$
\end_inset

 is constant but the right is random.
 This model does fit the Bayesian perspective: we combine information coming
 from the model and the data, summarized in 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y & = & X\beta+\varepsilon\\
\varepsilon & \sim & N(0,\sigma_{\varepsilon}^{2}I_{n})
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 with prior beliefs regarding the distribution of the parameter, summarized
 in
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R\beta\sim N(r,\sigma_{v}^{2}I_{q})
\]

\end_inset

 Since the sample is random it is reasonable to suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}(\varepsilon v^{\prime})=0,$
\end_inset

 which is the last piece of information in the specification.
 How can you estimate using this model? The solution is to treat the restriction
s as artificial data.
 Write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
y\\
r
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
X\\
R
\end{array}\right]\beta+\left[\begin{array}{c}
\varepsilon\\
v
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 This model is heteroscedastic, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\varepsilon}^{2}\neq\sigma_{v}^{2}.$
\end_inset

 Define the 
\emph on
prior precision
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $k=\sigma_{\varepsilon}/\sigma_{v}.$
\end_inset

 This expresses the degree of belief in the restriction relative to the
 variability of the data.
 Supposing that we specify 
\begin_inset Formula $k,$
\end_inset

 then the model 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
y\\
kr
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
X\\
kR
\end{array}\right]\beta+\left[\begin{array}{c}
\varepsilon\\
kv
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 is homoscedastic and can be estimated by OLS.
 Note that this estimator is biased.
 It is consistent, however, given that 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is a fixed constant, even if the restriction is false (this is in contrast
 to the case of false exact restrictions).
 To see this, note that there are 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 restrictions, where 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is the number of rows of 
\begin_inset Formula $R.$
\end_inset

 As 
\begin_inset Formula $n\rightarrow\infty,$
\end_inset

 these 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 artificial observations have no weight in the objective function, so the
 estimator has the same limiting objective function as the OLS
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

estimator, and is therefore consistent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To motivate the use of stochastic restrictions, consider the expectation
 of the squared length of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{E}(\hat{\beta}^{\prime}\hat{\beta}) & = & \mathcal{E}\left\{ \left(\beta+\left(X^{\prime}X\right)^{-1}X^{\prime}\varepsilon\right)^{\prime}\left(\beta+\left(X^{\prime}X\right)^{-1}X^{\prime}\varepsilon\right)\right\} \\
 & = & \beta^{\prime}\beta+\mathcal{E}\left(\varepsilon^{\prime}X(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\varepsilon\right)\\
 & = & \beta^{\prime}\beta+Tr\left(X^{\prime}X\right)^{-1}\sigma^{2}\\
 & = & \beta^{\prime}\beta+\sigma^{2}\sum_{i=1}^{K}\lambda_{i}\text{(the\:\ trace\:\ is\:\ the\:\ sum\:\ of\:\ eigenvalues)}\\
 & > & \beta^{\prime}\beta+\lambda_{\max\left(X^{\prime}X^{-1}\right)}\sigma^{2}\text{(the\:\ eigenvalues\:\ are\:\ all\:\ positive,\:\ since}X^{\prime}X\text{\:\ is\:\ p.d.}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{E}(\hat{\beta}^{\prime}\hat{\beta})>\beta^{\prime}\beta+\frac{\sigma^{2}}{\lambda_{\min\left(X^{\prime}X\right)}}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{\min\left(X^{\prime}X\right)}$
\end_inset

 is the minimum eigenvalue of 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{\prime}X$
\end_inset

 (which is the inverse of the maximum eigenvalue of 
\begin_inset Formula $(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}).$
\end_inset

 As collinearity becomes worse and worse, 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{\prime}X$
\end_inset

 becomes more nearly singular, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{\min\left(X^{\prime}X\right)}$
\end_inset

 tends to zero (recall that the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues)
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}(\hat{\beta}^{\prime}\hat{\beta})$
\end_inset

 tends to infinite.
 On the other hand, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{\prime}\beta$
\end_inset

 is finite.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now considering the restriction 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{K}\beta=0+v.$
\end_inset

 With this restriction the model becomes 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
y\\
0
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
X\\
kI_{K}
\end{array}\right]\beta+\left[\begin{array}{c}
\varepsilon\\
kv
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 and the estimator is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\beta}_{ridge} & = & \left(\left[\begin{array}{cc}
X^{\prime} & kI_{K}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
X\\
kI_{K}
\end{array}\right]\right)^{-1}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
X^{\prime} & I_{K}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
y\\
0
\end{array}\right]\\
 & = & \left(X^{\prime}X+k^{2}I_{K}\right)^{-1}X^{\prime}y
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 This is the ordinary 
\emph on
ridge regression
\emph default
 estimator.
 The ridge regression estimator can be seen to add 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{2}I_{K},$
\end_inset

 which is nonsingular, to 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{\prime}X,$
\end_inset

 which is more and more nearly singular as collinearity becomes worse and
 worse.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $k\rightarrow\infty,$
\end_inset

 the restrictions tend to 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=0,$
\end_inset

 that is, the coefficients are shrunken toward zero.
 Also, the estimator tends to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\beta}_{ridge}=\left(X^{\prime}X+k^{2}I_{K}\right)^{-1}X^{\prime}y\rightarrow\left(k^{2}I_{K}\right)^{-1}X^{\prime}y=\frac{X^{\prime}y}{k^{2}}\rightarrow0
\]

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}_{ridge}^{\prime}\hat{\beta}_{ridge}\rightarrow0.$
\end_inset

 This is clearly a false restriction in the limit, if our original model
 is at all sensible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There should be some amount of shrinkage that is in fact a true restriction.
 The problem is to determine the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 such that the restriction is correct.
 The interest in ridge regression centers on the fact that it can be shown
 that there exists a 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $MSE(\hat{\beta}_{ridge})<\hat{\beta}_{OLS}.$
\end_inset

 The problem is that this 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2},$
\end_inset

 which are unknown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ridge trace method plots 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}_{ridge}^{\prime}\hat{\beta}_{ridge}$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $k,$

\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

\emph on
Draw picture here.

 This means of choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $k$

 is obviously subjective.
 This is not a problem from the Bayesian perspective: the choice of

 reflects prior beliefs about the length of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta.$

\begin_layout Section
Measurement error
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Measurement error is exactly what it says, either the dependent variable
 or the regressors are measured with error.
 Thinking about the way economic data are reported, measurement error is
 probably quite prevalent.
 For example, estimates of growth of GDP, inflation, etc.
 are commonly revised several times.
 Why should the last revision necessarily be correct?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Error of measurement of the dependent variable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Measurement errors in the dependent variable and the regressors have important
 differences.
 First consider error in measurement of the dependent variable.
 The data generating process is presumed to be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y^{*} & = & X\beta+\varepsilon\\
y & = & y^{*}+v\\
v_{t} & \sim & iid(0,\sigma_{v}^{2})
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{*}=y+v$
\end_inset

 is the unobservable true dependent variable, and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 is what is observed.
 We assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 are independent and that 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{*}=X\beta+\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 satisfies the classical assumptions.
 Given this, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y+v=X\beta+\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y & = & X\beta+\varepsilon-v\\
 & = & X\beta+\omega\\
\omega_{t} & \sim & iid(0,\sigma_{\varepsilon}^{2}+\sigma_{v}^{2})
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As long as 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 is uncorrelated with 
\begin_inset Formula $X,$
\end_inset

 this model satisfies the classical assumptions and can be estimated by
 OLS.
 This type of measurement error isn't a problem, then, except in that the
 increased variability of the error term causes an increase in the variance
 of the OLS estimator (see equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:variance factors"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Error of measurement of the regressors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The situation isn't so good in this case.
 The DGP is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{t} & = & x_{t}^{*\prime}\beta+\varepsilon_{t}\\
x_{t} & = & x_{t}^{*}+v_{t}\\
v_{t} & \sim & iid(0,\Sigma_{v})
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{v}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $K\times K$
\end_inset

 matrix.
 Now 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{*}$
\end_inset

 contains the true, unobserved regressors, and 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is what is observed.
 Again assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon,$
\end_inset

 and that the model 
\begin_inset Formula $y=X^{*}\beta+\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 satisfies the classical assumptions.
 Now we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{t} & = & \left(x_{t}-v_{t}\right)^{\prime}\beta+\varepsilon_{t}\\
 & = & x_{t}^{\prime}\beta-v_{t}^{\prime}\beta+\varepsilon_{t}\\
 & = & x_{t}^{\prime}\beta+\omega_{t}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 The problem is that now there is a correlation between 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{t},$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{E}(x_{t}\omega_{t}) & = & \mathcal{E}\left(\left(x_{t}^{*}+v_{t}\right)\left(-v_{t}^{\prime}\beta+\varepsilon_{t}\right)\right)\\
 & = & -\Sigma_{v}\beta
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Sigma_{v}=\mathcal{E}\left(v_{t}v_{t}^{\prime}\right).
\]

\end_inset

 Because of this correlation, the OLS
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

estimator is biased and inconsistent, just as in the case of autocorrelated
 errors with lagged dependent variables.
 In matrix notation, write the estimated model as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y=X\beta+\omega
\]

\end_inset

 We have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\beta}=\left(\frac{X^{\prime}X}{n}\right)^{-1}\left(\frac{X^{\prime}y}{n}\right)
\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
plim\left(\frac{X^{\prime}X}{n}\right)^{-1} & = & plim\frac{\left(X^{*\prime}+V^{\prime}\right)\left(X^{*}+V\right)}{n}\\
 & = & \left(Q_{X^{*}}+\Sigma_{v}\right)^{-1}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 are independent, and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
plim\frac{V^{\prime}V}{n} & = & \lim\mathcal{E}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}v_{t}v_{t}^{\prime}\\
 & = & \Sigma_{v}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Likewise, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
plim\left(\frac{X^{\prime}y}{n}\right) & = & plim\frac{\left(X^{*\prime}+V^{\prime}\right)\left(X^{*}\beta+\varepsilon\right)}{n}\\
 & = & Q_{X^{*}}\beta
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
plim\hat{\beta}=\left(Q_{X^{*}}+\Sigma_{v}\right)^{-1}Q_{X^{*}}\beta
\]

\end_inset

 So we see that the least squares estimator is inconsistent when the regressors
 are measured with error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A potential solution to this problem is the instrumental variables (IV)
 estimator, which we'll discuss shortly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset

Measurement error in a dynamic model.
 Consider the model 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{t}^{*} & = & \alpha+\rho y_{t-1}^{*}+\beta x_{t}+\epsilon_{t}\\
y_{t} & = & y_{t}^{*}+\upsilon_{t}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 are independent Gaussian white noise errors.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is not observed, and instead we observe 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 What are the properties of the OLS regression on the equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=\alpha+\rho y_{t-1}+\beta x_{t}+\eta_{t}
\]

\end_inset

? The error is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\eta_{t} & =y_{t}-\alpha-\rho y_{t-1}-\beta x_{t}\\
 & =y_{t}^{*}+\upsilon_{t}-\alpha-\rho y_{t-1}^{*}-\rho\upsilon_{t-1}-\beta x_{t}\\
 & =\alpha+\rho y_{t-1}^{*}+\beta x_{t}+\epsilon_{t}+\upsilon_{t}-\alpha-\rho y_{t-1}^{*}-\rho\upsilon_{t-1}-\beta x_{t}\\
 & =\epsilon_{t}+\upsilon_{t}-\rho\upsilon_{t-1}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

So the error term is autocorrelated.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t-1}=\alpha+\rho y_{t-2}+\beta x_{t-1}+\eta_{t-1}
\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta_{t-1}=\epsilon_{t-1}+\upsilon_{t-1}-\rho\upsilon_{t-2},
\]

\end_inset

so the error 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{t}$
\end_inset

 and the regressor 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 are correlated, because they share the common term 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon_{t-1}.$
\end_inset

 This means that the equation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=\alpha+\rho y_{t-1}+\beta x_{t}+\eta_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 does not satisfy weak exogeneity, and the OLS estimator will be biased
 and inconsistent.

 The second panel repeats this with

: one of the classical assumptions (nonstochastic regressors) that guarantees

Missing observations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Missing observations occur quite frequently:
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

time series data may not be gathered in a certain year, or respondents to
 a survey may not answer all questions.
 We'll consider two cases: missing observations on the dependent variable
 and missing observations on the regressors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Missing observations on the dependent variable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y=X\beta+\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
y_{1}\\
y_{2}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
X_{1}\\
X_{2}
\end{array}\right]\beta+\left[\begin{array}{c}
\varepsilon_{1}\\
\varepsilon_{2}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 is not observed.
 Otherwise, we assume the classical assumptions hold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A clear alternative is to simply estimate using the compete observations
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{1}=X_{1}\beta+\varepsilon_{1}
\]

\end_inset

 Since these observations satisfy the classical assumptions, one could estimate
 by OLS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The question remains whether or not one could somehow replace the unobserved
 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 by a predictor, and improve over OLS in some sense.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{y}_{2}$
\end_inset

 be the predictor of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}.$
\end_inset

 Now 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\beta} & = & \left\{ \left[\begin{array}{c}
X_{1}\\
X_{2}
\end{array}\right]^{\prime}\left[\begin{array}{c}
X_{1}\\
X_{2}
\end{array}\right]\right\} ^{-1}\left[\begin{array}{c}
X_{1}\\
X_{2}
\end{array}\right]^{\prime}\left[\begin{array}{c}
y_{1}\\
\hat{y}_{2}
\end{array}\right]\\
 & = & \left[X_{1}^{\prime}X_{1}+X_{2}^{\prime}X_{2}\right]^{-1}\left[X_{1}^{\prime}y_{1}+X_{2}^{\prime}\hat{y}_{2}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 Recall that the OLS
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

fonc are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X^{\prime}X\hat{\beta}=X^{\prime}y
\]

\end_inset

 so if we regressed using only the first (complete)
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

observations, we would have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X_{1}^{\prime}X_{1}\hat{\beta}_{1}=X_{1}^{\prime}y_{1.}
\]

\end_inset

 Likewise, an OLS regression using only the second (filled in)
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

observations would give 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X_{2}^{\prime}X_{2}\hat{\beta}_{2}=X_{2}^{\prime}\hat{y}_{2}.
\]

\end_inset

 Substituting these into the equation for the overall combined estimator
 gives 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\beta} & = & \left[X_{1}^{\prime}X_{1}+X_{2}^{\prime}X_{2}\right]^{-1}\left[X_{1}^{\prime}X_{1}\hat{\beta}_{1}+X_{2}^{\prime}X_{2}\hat{\beta}_{2}\right]\\
 & = & \left[X_{1}^{\prime}X_{1}+X_{2}^{\prime}X_{2}\right]^{-1}X_{1}^{\prime}X_{1}\hat{\beta}_{1}+\left[X_{1}^{\prime}X_{1}+X_{2}^{\prime}X_{2}\right]^{-1}X_{2}^{\prime}X_{2}\hat{\beta}_{2}\\
 & \equiv & A\hat{\beta}_{1}+(I_{K}-A)\hat{\beta}_{2}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A\equiv\left[X_{1}^{\prime}X_{1}+X_{2}^{\prime}X_{2}\right]^{-1}X_{1}^{\prime}X_{1}
\]

\end_inset

 and we use 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left[X_{1}^{\prime}X_{1}+X_{2}^{\prime}X_{2}\right]^{-1}X_{2}^{\prime}X_{2} & = & \left[X_{1}^{\prime}X_{1}+X_{2}^{\prime}X_{2}\right]^{-1}\left[\left(X_{1}^{\prime}X_{1}+X_{2}^{\prime}X_{2}\right)-X_{1}^{\prime}X_{1}\right]\\
 & = & I_{K}-\left[X_{1}^{\prime}X_{1}+X_{2}^{\prime}X_{2}\right]^{-1}X_{1}^{\prime}X_{1}\\
 & = & I_{K}-A.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{E}(\hat{\beta})=A\beta+(I_{K}-A)\mathcal{E}\left(\hat{\beta}_{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

 and this will be unbiased only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}\left(\hat{\beta}_{2}\right)=\beta.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The conclusion is that the filled in observations alone would need to define
 an unbiased estimator.
 This will be the case only if 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{y}_{2}=X_{2}\beta+\hat{\varepsilon}_{2}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\varepsilon}_{2}$
\end_inset

 has mean zero.
 Clearly, it is difficult to satisfy this condition without knowledge of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Note that putting 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{y}_{2}=\bar{y}_{1}$
\end_inset

 does not satisfy the condition and therefore leads to a biased estimator.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Exercise
Formally prove this last statement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The sample selection problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the above discussion we assumed that the missing observations are random.
 The sample selection problem is a case where the missing observations are
 not random.
 Consider the model 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}^{*}=x_{t}^{\prime}\beta+\varepsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 which is assumed to satisfy the classical assumptions.
 However, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}^{*\;}$
\end_inset

 is not always observed.
 What is observed is 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=y_{t}^{*}\text{\textnormal{ }if }y_{t}^{*}\geq0
\]

\end_inset

 Or, in other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is missing when it is less than zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The difference in this case is that the missing values are not random:
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

they are correlated with the 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}.$
\end_inset

 Consider the case 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y^{*}=x+\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\varepsilon)=25$
\end_inset

, but using only the observations for which 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{*}>0$
\end_inset

 to estimate.

There are means of dealing with sample selection bias, but we will not go
 into it here.
 One should at least be aware that nonrandom selection of the sample will
 normally lead to bias and inconsistency if the problem is not taken into
 account.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Missing observations on the regressors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again the model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
y_{1}\\
y_{2}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
X_{1}\\
X_{2}
\end{array}\right]\beta+\left[\begin{array}{c}
\varepsilon_{1}\\
\varepsilon_{2}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 but we assume now that each row of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}$
\end_inset

 has an unobserved component(s).
 Again, one could just estimate using the complete observations, but it
 may seem frustrating to have to drop observations simply because of a single
 missing variable.
 In general, if the unobserved 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}$
\end_inset

 is replaced by some prediction, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}^{*},$
\end_inset

 then we are in the case of errors of observation.
 As before, this means that the OLS
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

estimator is biased when 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is used instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}.$
\end_inset

 Consistency is salvaged, however, as long as the number of missing observations
 doesn't increase with 
\begin_inset Formula $n.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Including observations that have missing values replaced by 
\emph on
ad hoc
\emph default
 values can be interpreted as introducing false stochastic restrictions.
 In general, this introduces bias.
 It is difficult to determine whether MSE increases or decreases.
 Monte Carlo studies suggest that it is dangerous to simply substitute the
 mean, for example.

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph default

 This is a special case that doesn't hold for 
\begin_inset Formula $K>2.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Exercise

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In summary, if one is strongly concerned with bias, it is best to drop observati
ons that have missing components.
 There is potential for reduction of MSE through filling in missing elements
 with intelligent guesses, but this could also increase MSE.

Missing regressors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that the model 
\begin_inset Formula $y=X\beta+W\gamma+\epsilon$
\end_inset

 satisfies the classical assumptions, so OLS would be a consistent estimator.
 However, let's suppose that the regressors 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 are not available in the sample.
 What are the properties of the OLS estimator of the model 
\begin_inset Formula $y=X\beta+\omega?$
\end_inset

 We can think of this as a case of imposing false restrictions: 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=0$
\end_inset

 when in fact 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\ne0$
\end_inset

.
 We know that the restricted least squares estimator is biased and inconsistent,
 in general, when we impose false restrictions.
 Another way of thinking of this is to look to see if 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 are correlated.
 We have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
E(X_{t}\omega_{t}) & =E\left(X_{t}\left(W_{t}^{\prime}\gamma+\epsilon_{t}\right)\right)\\
 & =E(X_{t}W_{t}^{\prime}\gamma)+E(X_{t}\epsilon_{t})\\
 & =E(X_{t}W_{t}^{\prime}\gamma)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where the last line follows because 
\begin_inset Formula $E(X_{t}\epsilon_{t})=0$
\end_inset

 by assumption.
 So, there will be correlation between the error and the regressors if there
 is collinearity between the included regressors 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

 and the missing regressors 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 If there is not, the OLS estimator will be consistent.
 Because the normal thing is to have collinearity between regressors, we
 expect that missing regressors will lead to bias and inconsistency of the
 OLS estimator.

\begin_layout Chapter
Functional form and nonnested tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though theory often suggests which conditioning variables should be included,
 and suggests the signs of certain derivatives, it is usually silent regarding
 the functional form of the relationship between the dependent variable
 and the regressors.
 For example, considering a cost function, one could have a Cobb-Douglas
 model 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c=Aw_{1}^{\beta_{1}}w_{2}^{\beta_{2}}q^{\beta_{q}}e^{\varepsilon}
\]

\end_inset

 This model, after taking logarithms, gives 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ln c=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\ln w_{1}+\beta_{2}\ln w_{2}+\beta_{q}\ln q+\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}=\ln A.$
\end_inset

 Theory suggests that 
\begin_inset Formula $A>0,\beta_{1}>0,\beta_{2}>0,\beta_{3}>0.$
\end_inset

 This model isn't compatible with a fixed cost of production since 
\begin_inset Formula $c=0$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $q=0.$
\end_inset

 Homogeneity of degree one in input prices suggests that 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}=1,$
\end_inset

 while constant returns to scale implies 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{q}=1.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While this model may be reasonable in some cases, an alternative 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{c}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\sqrt{w_{1}}+\beta_{2}\sqrt{w_{2}}+\beta_{q}\sqrt{q}+\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset

 may be just as plausible.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(x)$
\end_inset

 look quite alike, for certain values of the regressors, and up to a linear
 transformation, so it may be difficult to choose between these models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic point is that many functional forms are compatible with the linear-in-
parameters model, since this model can incorporate a wide variety of nonlinear
 transformations of the dependent variable and the regressors.
 For example, suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 is a real valued function and that 
\begin_inset Formula $x(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $K-$
\end_inset

 vector-valued function.
 The following model is linear in the parameters but nonlinear in the variables:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
x_{t} & = & x(z_{t})\\
y_{t} & = & x_{t}^{\prime}\beta+\varepsilon_{t}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 There may be 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 fundamental conditioning variables 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{t}$
\end_inset

, but there may be 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 regressors, where 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 may be smaller than, equal to or larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $P.$
\end_inset

 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 could include squares and cross products of the conditioning variables
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{t}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Flexible functional forms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that the functional form of the relationship between the dependent
 variable and the regressors is in general unknown, one might wonder if
 there exist parametric models that can closely approximate a wide variety
 of functional relationships.
 A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Diewert-Flexible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 functional form is defined as one such that the function, the vector of
 first derivatives and the matrix of second derivatives can take on an arbitrary
 value 
\emph on
at a single data point.

\emph default
 Flexibility in this sense clearly requires that there be at least 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K=1+P+\left(P^{2}-P\right)/2+P
\]

\end_inset

 free parameters: one for each independent effect that we wish to model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that the model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y=g(x)+\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset

 A second-order Taylor's series expansion (with remainder term) of the function
 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)$
\end_inset

 about the point 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g(x)=g(0)+x^{\prime}D_{x}g(0)+\frac{x^{\prime}D_{x}^{2}g(0)x}{2}+R
\]

\end_inset

 Use the approximation, which simply drops the remainder term, as an approximati
on to 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x):$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g(x)\simeq g_{K}(x)=g(0)+x^{\prime}D_{x}g(0)+\frac{x^{\prime}D_{x}^{2}g(0)x}{2}
\]

\end_inset

 As 
\begin_inset Formula $x\rightarrow0,$
\end_inset

 the approximation becomes more and more exact, in the sense that 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{K}(x)\rightarrow g(x),$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{x}g_{K}(x)\rightarrow D_{x}g(x)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{x}^{2}g_{K}(x)\rightarrow D_{x}^{2}g(x).$
\end_inset

 For 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0,$
\end_inset

 the approximation is exact, up to the second order.
 The idea behind many flexible functional forms is to note that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(0),$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{x}g(0)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{x}^{2}g(0)$
\end_inset

 are all constants.
 If we treat them as parameters, the approximation will have exactly enough
 free parameters to approximate the function 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x),$
\end_inset

 which is of unknown form, exactly, up to second order, at the point 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0.$
\end_inset

 The model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g_{K}(x)=\alpha+x^{\prime}\beta+1/2x^{\prime}\Gamma x
\]

\end_inset

 so the regression model to fit is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y=\alpha+x^{\prime}\beta+1/2x^{\prime}\Gamma x+\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
While the regression model has enough free parameters to be Diewert-flexible,
 the question remains: is 
\begin_inset Formula $plim\hat{\alpha}=g(0)?$
\end_inset

 Is 
\begin_inset Formula $plim\hat{\beta}=D_{x}g(0)?$
\end_inset

 Is 
\begin_inset Formula $plim\hat{\Gamma}=D_{x}^{2}g(0)?$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The answer is no, in general.
 The reason is that if we treat the true values of the parameters as these
 derivatives, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 is forced to play the part of the remainder term, which is a function of
 
\begin_inset Formula $x,$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 are correlated in this case.
 As before, the estimator is biased in this case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A simpler example would be to consider a first-order T.S.
 approximation to a quadratic function.

\begin_layout Itemize
The conclusion is that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flexible functional forms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 aren't really flexible in a useful statistical sense, in that neither the
 function itself nor its derivatives are consistently estimated, unless
 the function belongs to the parametric family of the specified functional
 form.
 In order to lead to consistent inferences, the regression model must be
 correctly specified.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The translog form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In spite of the fact that FFF's aren't really flexible for the purposes
 of econometric estimation and inference, they are useful, and they are
 certainly subject to less bias due to misspecification of the functional
 form than are many popular forms, such as the Cobb-Douglas or the simple
 linear in the variables model.
 The translog model is probably the most widely used FFF.
 This model is as above, except that the variables are subjected to a logarithmi
c tranformation.
 Also, the expansion point is usually taken to be the sample mean of the
 data, after the logarithmic transformation.
 The model is defined by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y & = & \ln(c)\\
x & = & \ln\left(\frac{z}{\bar{z}}\right)\\
 & = & \ln(z)-\ln(\bar{z})\\
y & = & \alpha+x^{\prime}\beta+1/2x^{\prime}\Gamma x+\varepsilon
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 In this presentation, the 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 subscript that distinguishes observations is suppressed for simplicity.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} & = & \beta+\Gamma x\\
 & = & \frac{\partial\ln(c)}{\partial\ln(z)}\text{\:(the\:\ other\:\ part\:\ of\:}x\,\text{is\:\ constant)}\\
 & = & \frac{\partial c}{\partial z}\frac{z}{c}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 which is the elasticity of 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $z.$
\end_inset

 This is a convenient feature of the translog model.
 Note that at the means of the conditioning variables, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{z}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0,$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left.\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right|_{z=\bar{z}}=\beta
\]

\end_inset

 so the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 are the first-order elasticities, at the means of the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate, consider that 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 is cost of production: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y=c(w,q)
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is a vector of input prices and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is output.
 We could add other variables by extending 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 in the obvious manner, but this is supressed for simplicity.
 By Shephard's lemma, the conditional factor demands are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=\frac{\partial c(w,q)}{\partial w}
\]

\end_inset

 and the cost shares of the factors are therefore 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s=\frac{wx}{c}=\frac{\partial c(w,q)}{\partial w}\frac{w}{c}
\]

\end_inset

 which is simply the vector of elasticities of cost with respect to input
 prices.
 If the cost function is modeled using a translog function, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\ln(c) & = & \alpha+x^{\prime}\beta+z^{\prime}\delta+1/2\left[\begin{array}{cc}
x^{\prime} & z\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\Gamma_{11} & \Gamma_{12}\\
\Gamma_{12}^{\prime} & \Gamma_{22}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
x\\
z
\end{array}\right]\\
 & = & \alpha+x^{\prime}\beta+z^{\prime}\delta+1/2x^{\prime}\Gamma_{11}x+x^{\prime}\Gamma_{12}z+1/2z^{2}\gamma_{22}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\ln(w/\bar{w})$
\end_inset

 (element-by-element division) and 
\begin_inset Formula $z=\ln(q/\bar{q}),$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Gamma_{11} & = & \left[\begin{array}{ll}
\gamma_{11} & \gamma_{12}\\
\gamma_{12} & \gamma_{22}
\end{array}\right]\\
\Gamma_{12} & = & \left[\begin{array}{l}
\gamma_{13}\\
\gamma_{23}
\end{array}\right]\\
\Gamma_{22} & = & \gamma_{33}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 Note that symmetry of the second derivatives has been imposed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the share equations are just 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s=\beta+\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\Gamma_{11} & \Gamma_{12}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
x\\
z
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 Therefore, the share equations and the cost equation have parameters in
 common.
 By pooling the equations together and imposing the (true) restriction that
 the parameters of the equations be the same, we can gain efficiency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate in more detail, consider the case of two inputs, so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=\left[\begin{array}{l}
x_{1}\\
x_{2}
\end{array}\right].
\]

\end_inset

 In this case the translog model of the logarithmic cost function is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ln c=\alpha+\beta_{1}x_{1}+\beta_{2}x_{2}+\delta z+\frac{\gamma_{11}}{2}x_{1}^{2}+\frac{\gamma_{22}}{2}x_{2}^{2}+\frac{\gamma_{33}}{2}z^{2}+\gamma_{12}x_{1}x_{2}+\gamma_{13}x_{1}z+\gamma_{23}x_{2}z
\]

\end_inset

 The two cost shares of the inputs are the derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln c$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$

\end{eqnarray*}

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the share equations and the cost equation have parameters in common.
 One can do a pooled estimation of the three equations at once, imposing
 that the parameters are the same.
 In this way we're using more observations and therefore more information,
 which will lead to imporved efficiency.
 Note that this does assume that the cost equation is correctly specified
 (
\emph on
i.e.,
\emph default
 not an approximation), since otherwise the derivatives would not be the
 true derivatives of the log cost function, and would then be misspecified
 for the shares.
 To pool the equations, write the model in matrix form (adding in error
 terms) 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{l}

 With the appropriate notation, a single observation can be written as

\end_inset

 The overall model would stack 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 observations on the three equations for a total of

 Next we need to consider the errors.
 For observation 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

 the errors can be placed in a vector 
\begin_inset Formula

\varepsilon_{t}=\left[\begin{array}{l}

the shares are certainly correlated since they must sum to one.
 (In fact, with 2 shares the variances are equal and the covariance is -1
 times the variance.
 General notation is used to allow easy extension to the case of more than
 2 inputs).
 Also, it's likely that the shares and the cost equation have different
 variances.
 Supposing that the model is covariance stationary, the variance of

\end_inset

 Note that this matrix is singular, since the shares sum to 1.
 Assuming that there is no autocorrelation, the overall covariance matrix

won't be efficient.
 The next question is: how do we estimate efficiently using FGLS? FGLS is
 based upon inverting the estimated error covariance 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\Sigma}.$

 So we need to estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma.$

Next we need to account for the singularity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{0}.$
\end_inset

 It can be shown that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\Sigma}_{0}$
\end_inset

 will be singular when the shares sum to one, so FGLS won't work.
 The solution is to drop one of the share equations, for example the second.
 The model becomes 
\begin_inset Formula

 or in matrix notation for the observation: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}^{\ast}=X_{t}^{\ast}\theta+\varepsilon_{t}^{\ast}

\end_inset

 and in stacked notation for all observations we have the 
\begin_inset Formula $2n$

\end_inset

 or, finally in matrix notation for all observations: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y^{\ast}=X^{\ast}\theta+\varepsilon^{\ast}

\end_inset

 Considering the error covariance, we can define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Sigma_{0}^{\ast} & = & Var\left[\begin{array}{l}

\varepsilon_{2}
\end{array}\right]\\
\Sigma^{\ast} & = & I_{n}\otimes\Sigma_{0}^{\ast}

\begin_inset Formula

 Another restriction that the model should satisfy is that the estimated

Testing nonnested hypotheses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that the choice of functional form isn't perfectly clear, in that
 many possibilities exist, how can one choose between forms? When one form
 is a parametric restriction of another, the previously studied tests such
 as Wald, LR, score or 
\begin_inset Formula $qF$
\end_inset

 are all possibilities.
 For example, the Cobb-Douglas model is a parametric restriction of the
 translog: The translog is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=\alpha+x_{t}^{\prime}\beta+1/2x_{t}^{\prime}\Gamma x_{t}+\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset

 where the variables are in logarithms, while the Cobb-Douglas is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=\alpha+x_{t}^{\prime}\beta+\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset

 so a test of the Cobb-Douglas versus the translog is simply a test that
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma=0.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The situation is more complicated when we want to test 
\emph on
non-nested hypotheses.

\emph default
 If the two functional forms are linear in the parameters, and use the same
 transformation of the dependent variable, then they may be written as 
\begin_inset Formula

M_{1}:y & = & X\beta+\varepsilon\\
\varepsilon_{t} & \sim & iid(0,\sigma_{\varepsilon}^{2})\\
M_{2}:y & = & Z\gamma+\eta\\
\eta & \sim & iid(0,\sigma_{\eta}^{2})

 We wish to test hypotheses of the form: 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}:M_{i}$

\emph default
 versus 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{A}:M_{i}$

There are a number of ways to proceed.
 We'll consider the 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 test, proposed by Davidson and MacKinnon, 
\emph on
Econometrica
\emph default
 (1981).
 The idea is to artificially nest the two models, e.g., 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y=(1-\alpha)X\beta+\alpha(Z\gamma)+\omega
\]

\end_inset

 If the first model is correctly specified, then the true value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is zero.
 On the other hand, if the second model is correctly specified then 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=1.$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Separator latexpar

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The problem is that this model is not identified in general.
 For example, if the models share some regressors, as in 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
M_{1}:y_{t} & = & \beta_{1}+\beta_{2}x_{2t}+\beta_{3}x_{3t}+\varepsilon_{t}\\
M_{2}:y_{t} & = & \gamma_{1}+\gamma_{2}x_{2t}+\gamma_{3}x_{4t}+\eta_{t}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 then the composite model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=(1-\alpha)\beta_{1}+(1-\alpha)\beta_{2}x_{2t}+(1-\alpha)\beta_{3}x_{3t}+\alpha\gamma_{1}+\alpha\gamma_{2}x_{2t}+\alpha\gamma_{3}x_{4t}+\omega_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 Combining terms we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{t} & = & \left((1-\alpha)\beta_{1}+\alpha\gamma_{1}\right)+\left((1-\alpha)\beta_{2}+\alpha\gamma_{2}\right)x_{2t}+(1-\alpha)\beta_{3}x_{3t}+\alpha\gamma_{3}x_{4t}+\omega_{t}\\
 & = & \delta_{1}+\delta_{2}x_{2t}+\delta_{3}x_{3t}+\delta_{4}x_{4t}+\omega_{t}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 The four 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta^{\prime}s$
\end_inset

 are consistently estimable, but 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is not, since we have four equations in 7 unknowns, so one can't test the
 hypothesis that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=0.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea of the 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 test is to substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 in place of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma.$
\end_inset

 This is a consistent estimator supposing that the second model is correctly
 specified.
 It will tend to a finite probability limit even if the second model is
 misspecified.
 Then estimate the model 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y & = & (1-\alpha)X\beta+\alpha(Z\hat{\gamma})+\omega\\
 & = & X\theta+\alpha\hat{y}+\omega
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{y}=Z(Z^{\prime}Z)^{-1}Z^{\prime}y=P_{Z}y.$
\end_inset

 In this model, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is consistently estimable, and one can show that, under the hypothesis
 that the first model is correct, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\overset{p}{\rightarrow}0$
\end_inset

 and that the ordinary 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 -statistic for 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=0$
\end_inset

 is asymptotically normal: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t=\frac{\hat{\alpha}}{\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\alpha}}}\overset{a}{\sim}N(0,1)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the second model is correctly specified, then 
\begin_inset Formula $t\overset{p}{\rightarrow}\infty,$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 tends in probability to 1, while it's estimated standard error tends to
 zero.
 Thus the test will always reject the false null model, asymptotically,
 since the statistic will eventually exceed any critical value with probability
 one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We can reverse the roles of the models, testing the second against the first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It may be the case that 
\emph on
neither
\emph default
 model is correctly specified.
 In this case, the test will still reject the null hypothesis, asymptotically,
 if we use critical values from the 
\begin_inset Formula $N(0,1)$
\end_inset

 distribution, since as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 tends to something different from zero, 
\begin_inset Formula $|t|\overset{p}{\rightarrow}\infty.$
\end_inset

 Of course, when we switch the roles of the models the other will also be
 rejected asymptotically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In summary, there are 4 possible outcomes when we test two models, each
 against the other.
 Both may be rejected, neither may be rejected, or one of the two may be
 rejected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are other tests available for non-nested models.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $J-$
\end_inset

 test is simple to apply when both models are linear in the parameters.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

-test is similar, but easier to apply when 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{1}$
\end_inset

 is nonlinear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The above presentation assumes that the same transformation of the dependent
 variable is used by both models.

 and later we'll look at the consequences of relaxing this admittedly unrealisti
c assumption.
 The model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y & = & X\beta+\varepsilon\\
\mathcal{E}(\varepsilon) & = & 0\\
V(\varepsilon) & = & \Sigma
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 is a general symmetric positive definite matrix (we'll write 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 in place of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}$
\end_inset

 to simplify the typing of these notes).

 This is known as

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The case where

 disturbances, though why this term is used, I have no idea.
 Perhaps it's because under the classical assumptions, a joint confidence
 region for 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 would be an 
\begin_inset Formula $n-$
\end_inset

 dimensional hypersphere.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Effects of non-spherical disturbances on the OLS estimator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The least square estimator is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\beta} & = & (X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}y\\
 & = & \beta+(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\varepsilon
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We have unbiasedness, as before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{E}\left[(\hat{\beta}-\beta)(\hat{\beta}-\beta)^{\prime}\right] & = & \mathcal{E}\left[(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\varepsilon\varepsilon^{\prime}X(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}\right]\nonumber \\
 & = & (X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\Sigma X(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}\label{OLS covariance with nonspaerical}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

 Due to this, any test statistic that is based upon an estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 is invalid, since there 
\emph on
isn't
\emph default
 any 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

, it doesn't exist as a feature of the true d.g.p.
 In particular, the formulas for the 
\begin_inset Formula $t,$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $F,\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 based tests given above do not lead to statistics with these distributions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is still consistent, following exactly the same argument given before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 is normally distributed, then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\beta}\sim N\left(\beta,(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\Sigma X(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}\right)
\]

\end_inset

 The problem is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 is unknown in general, so this distribution won't be useful for testing
 hypotheses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Without normality, and with stochastic 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 (e.g., weakly exogenous regressors) we still have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\beta}-\beta\right) & = & \sqrt{n}(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\varepsilon\\
 & = & \left(\frac{X^{\prime}X}{n}\right)^{-1}n^{-1/2}X^{\prime}\varepsilon
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 Define the limiting variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-1/2}X^{\prime}\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 (supposing a CLT applies) as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\mathcal{E}\left(\frac{X^{\prime}\varepsilon\varepsilon^{\prime}X}{n}\right)=\Omega,\,\textrm{a.s.}
\]

\end_inset

 so we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\beta}-\beta\right)\overset{d}{\rightarrow}N\left(0,Q_{X}^{-1}\Omega Q_{X}^{-1}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the true asymptotic distribution of the OLS has changed with
 respect to the results under the classical assumptions.
 If we neglect to take this into account, the Wald and score tests will
 not be asymptotically valid.
 So we need to figure out 
\emph on
how 
\emph default
to take it into account.

 This script does a Monte Carlo study, generating data that are either heterosce

 of a nominally 10% t-test.
 When the data are heteroscedastic, we obtain something like what we see
 in Figure

 This sort of heteroscedasticity causes us to reject a true null hypothesis
 regarding the slope parameter much too often.
 You can experiment with the script to look at the effects of other sorts
 of HET, and to vary the sample size.

 Then one could form the Cholesky decomposition
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $P$

 We have 
\begin_inset Formula

 so 
\begin_inset Formula

Consider the model 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

 or, making the obvious definitions, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

 This variance of

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{E}(P\varepsilon\varepsilon^{\prime}P^{\prime}) & = & P\Sigma P^{\prime}\\

 & = & (X^{\prime}P'PX)^{-1}X^{\prime}P'Py\\
 & = & (X^{\prime}\Sigma^{-1}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\Sigma^{-1}y
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
The GLS

estimator is unbiased in the same circumstances under which the OLS

\end_inset

estimator is unbiased.
 For example, assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is nonstochastic 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{E}(\hat{\beta}_{GLS}) & = & \mathcal{E}\left\{ (X^{\prime}\Sigma^{-1}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\Sigma^{-1}y\right\} \\
 & = & \mathcal{E}\left\{ (X^{\prime}\Sigma^{-1}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\Sigma^{-1}(X\beta+\varepsilon\right\} \\
 & = & \beta.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

To get the variance of the estimator, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\beta}_{GLS} & = & (X^{*\prime}X^{*})^{-1}X^{*\prime}y^{*}\\
 & = & (X^{*\prime}X^{*})^{-1}X^{*\prime}\left(X^{*}\beta+\varepsilon^{*}\right)\\

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{E}\left\{ \left(\hat{\beta}_{GLS}-\beta\right)\left(\hat{\beta}_{GLS}-\beta\right)^{\prime}\right\}  & = & \mathcal{E}\left\{ (X^{*\prime}X^{*})^{-1}X^{*\prime}\varepsilon^{*}\varepsilon^{*\prime}X^{*}(X^{*\prime}X^{*})^{-1}\right\} \\
 & = & (X^{*\prime}X^{*})^{-1}X^{*\prime}X^{*}(X^{*\prime}X^{*})^{-1}\\

Either of these last formulas can be used.

\begin_layout Itemize
All the previous results regarding the desirable properties of the least

\begin_layout Itemize
Tests are valid, using the previous formulas, as long as we substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 in place of 
\begin_inset Formula $X.$
\end_inset

 Furthermore, any test that involves 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$

 can set it to 
\begin_inset Formula $1.$

estimator.
 This is a consequence of the Gauss-Markov theorem, since the GLS estimator
 is based on a model that satisfies the classical assumptions but the OLS
 estimator is not.
 To see this directly, note that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Var(\hat{\beta})-Var(\hat{\beta}_{GLS}) & = & (X'X)^{-1}X'\Sigma X(X'X)^{-1}-(X'\Sigma^{-1}X)^{-1}\\
 & = & A\Sigma A^{'}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $A=\left[\left(X^{\prime}X\right)^{-1}X^{\prime}-(X'\Sigma^{-1}X)^{-1}X'\Sigma^{-1}\right].$
\end_inset

 This may not seem obvious, but it is true, as you can verify for yourself.
 Then noting that 
\begin_inset Formula $A\Sigma A^{'}$
\end_inset

 is a quadratic form in a positive definite matrix, we conclude that 
\begin_inset Formula $A\Sigma A^{'}$
\end_inset

 is positive semi-definite, and that GLS is efficient relative to OLS.

\begin_layout Standard
Heteroscedasticity is the case where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{E}(\varepsilon\varepsilon^{\prime})=\Sigma

\end_inset

 is a diagonal matrix, so that the errors are uncorrelated, but have different
 variances.
 Heteroscedasticity is usually thought of as associated with cross sectional
 data, though there is absolutely no reason why time series data cannot
 also be heteroscedastic.
 Actually, the popular ARCH (autoregressive conditionally heteroscedastic)
 models explicitly assume that a time series is conditionally heteroscedastic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a supply function 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{i}$
\end_inset

 is price and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}$
\end_inset

 is some measure of size of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 firm.
 One might suppose that unobservable factors (e.g., talent of managers, degree
 of coordination between production units, 
\emph on
etc.
\emph default
) account for the error term 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{i}.$
\end_inset

 If there is more variability in these factors for large firms than for
 small firms, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

 may have a higher variance when 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}$
\end_inset

 is high than when it is low.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another example, individual demand.

 is price and 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is income.
 In this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

 can reflect variations in preferences.
 There are more possibilities for expression of preferences when one is
 rich, so it is possible that the variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{i}$

estimator has asymptotic distribution 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\beta}-\beta\right)\overset{d}{\rightarrow}N\left(0,Q_{X}^{-1}\Omega Q_{X}^{-1}\right)
\]

\end_inset

 as we've already seen.
 Recall that we defined 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\mathcal{E}\left(\frac{X^{\prime}\varepsilon\varepsilon^{\prime}X}{n}\right)=\Omega
\]

\end_inset

 This matrix has dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $K\times K$
\end_inset

 and can be consistently estimated, even if we can't estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 consistently.
 The consistent estimator, under heteroscedasticity but no autocorrelation
 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{\Omega}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}x_{t}x_{t}^{\prime}\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}^{2}
\]

\end_inset

 One can then modify the previous test statistics to obtain tests that are
 valid when there is heteroscedasticity of unknown form.
 For example, the Wald test for 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}:R\beta-r=0$
\end_inset

 would be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n\left(R\hat{\beta}-r\right)^{\prime}\left(R\left(\frac{X^{\prime}X}{n}\right)^{-1}\hat{\Omega}\left(\frac{X^{\prime}X}{n}\right)^{-1}R^{\prime}\right)^{-1}\left(R\hat{\beta}-r\right)\overset{a}{\sim}\chi^{2}(q)
\]

\end_inset

.
 The model is estimated using the first and third parts of the sample, separatel
y, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}^{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}^{3}$
\end_inset

 will be independent.
 Then we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\hat{\varepsilon}^{1\prime}\hat{\varepsilon}^{1}}{\sigma^{2}}=\frac{\varepsilon^{1^{\prime}}M^{1}\varepsilon^{1}}{\sigma^{2}}\overset{d}{\rightarrow}\chi^{2}(n_{1}-K)
\]

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\hat{\varepsilon}^{1\prime}\hat{\varepsilon}^{1}/(n_{1}-K)}{\hat{\varepsilon}^{3\prime}\hat{\varepsilon}^{3}/(n_{3}-K)}\overset{d}{\rightarrow}F(n_{1}-K,n_{3}-K).
\]

\end_inset

 The distributional result is exact if the errors are normally distributed.
 This test is a two-tailed test.
 Alternatively, and probably more conventionally, if one has prior ideas
 about the possible magnitudes of the variances of the observations, one
 could order the observations accordingly, from largest to smallest.
 In this case, one would use a conventional one-tailed F-test.

\begin_layout Itemize
The motive for dropping the middle observations is to increase the difference
 between the average variance in the subsamples, supposing that there exists
 heteroscedasticity.
 This can increase the power of the test.
 On the other hand, dropping too many observations will substantially increase
 the variance of the statistics 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\varepsilon}^{1\prime}\hat{\varepsilon}^{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\varepsilon}^{3\prime}\hat{\varepsilon}^{3}.$

 A rule of thumb, based on Monte Carlo experiments is to drop around 25%
 of the observations.

When one has little idea if there exists heteroscedasticity, and no idea

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{E}(\varepsilon_{t}^{2}|x_{t})=\sigma^{2},\forall t
\]

\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 or functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 shouldn't help to explain 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}(\varepsilon_{t}^{2}).$
\end_inset

 The test works as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 isn't available, use the consistent estimator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}$
\end_inset

 instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Regress 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}^{2}=\sigma^{2}+z_{t}^{\prime}\gamma+v_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{t}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

-vector.
 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{t}$
\end_inset

 may include some or all of the variables in 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t},$
\end_inset

 as well as other variables.
 White's original suggestion was to use 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

, plus the set of all unique squares and cross products of variables in
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Test the hypothesis that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=0.$
\end_inset

 The 
\begin_inset Formula $qF$
\end_inset

 statistic in this case is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
qF=\frac{P\left(ESS_{R}-ESS_{U}\right)/P}{ESS_{U}/\left(n-P-1\right)}
\]

\end_inset

 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $ESS_{R}=TSS_{U},$
\end_inset

 so dividing both numerator and denominator by this we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
qF=\left(n-P-1\right)\frac{R^{2}}{1-R^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

 Note that this is the 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 of the artificial regression used to test for heteroscedasticity, not the
 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 of the original model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An asymptotically equivalent statistic, under the null of no heteroscedasticity
 (so that 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 should tend to zero), is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
nR^{2}\overset{a}{\sim}\chi^{2}(P).
\]

\end_inset

 This doesn't require normality of the errors, though it does assume that
 the fourth moment of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 is constant, under the null.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The White test has the disadvantage that it may not be very powerful unless
 the

 vector is chosen well, and this is hard to do without knowledge of the
 form of heteroscedasticity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It also has the problem that specification errors other than heteroscedasticity
 may lead to rejection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Note: the null hypothesis of this test may be interpreted as 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=0$
\end_inset

 for the variance model 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\varepsilon_{t}^{2})=h(\alpha+z_{t}^{\prime}\theta),$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $h(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 is an arbitrary function of unknown form.
 The test is more general than is may appear from the regression that is
 used.

 Like the Goldfeld-Quandt test, this will be more informative if the observation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Correction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Correcting for heteroscedasticity requires that a parametric form for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma(\theta)$
\end_inset

 be supplied, and that a means for estimating 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 consistently be determined.
 The estimation method will be specific to the assumed form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma(\theta).$
\end_inset

 In recent years, there has been a trend toward simply estimating by OLS,
 and using robust standard errors.
 This may be somewhat unfortunate, as the weighted least squares estimator
 (GLS when there is only HET) is still consistent even if the specification
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma(\theta)$
\end_inset

 is incorrect, and it may be a good deal more efficient than OLS.
 Also, robust standard errors don't always work so well.

 illustrates these points.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps a middle ground is to attempt to use GLS when severe HET is detected,
 but to continue to use robust standard errors, to account for misspecifications
 in the modeling of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma(\theta).$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'll consider two examples.
 Before this, let's consider the general nature of GLS
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

when there is heteroscedasticity.
 When we have HET but no AUT, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 is a diagonal matrix:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Sigma=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\sigma_{1}^{2} & 0 & \ldots & 0\\
\vdots & \sigma_{2}^{2} &  & \vdots\\
 &  & \ddots & 0\\
0 & \cdots & 0 & \sigma_{n}^{2}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

Likewise, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is diagonal
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Sigma^{-1}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\frac{1}{\sigma_{1}^{2}} & 0 & \ldots & 0\\
\vdots & \frac{1}{\sigma_{2}^{2}} &  & \vdots\\
 &  & \ddots & 0\\
0 & \cdots & 0 & \frac{1}{\sigma_{n}^{2}}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

and so is the Cholesky decomposition 
\begin_inset Formula $P=chol(\Sigma^{-1}$
\end_inset

)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\frac{1}{\sigma_{1}} & 0 & \ldots & 0\\
\vdots & \frac{1}{\sigma_{2}} &  & \vdots\\
 &  & \ddots & 0\\
0 & \cdots & 0 & \frac{1}{\sigma_{n}}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 We need to transform the model, just as before, in the general case: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Py=PX\beta+P\varepsilon,
\]

\end_inset

 or, making the obvious definitions, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y^{*}=X^{*}\beta+\varepsilon^{*}.
\]

\end_inset

 Note that multiplying by 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 just divides the data for each observation (
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i},x_{i})$
\end_inset

 by the corresponding standard error of the error term, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}^{*}=y_{i}/\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}^{*}=x_{i}/\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 (note that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

-vector: we divided each element, including the 1 corresponding to the constant).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This makes sense.
 Consider Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Motivation-for-GLS"

\end_inset

, which shows a true regression line with heteroscedastic errors.
 Which sample is more informative about the location of the line? The ones
 with observations with smaller variances.
 So, the GLS solution is equivalent to OLS on the transformed data.
 By the transformed data is the original data, weighted by the inverse of
 the standard error of the observation's error term.
 When the standard error is small, the weight is high, and vice versa.
 The GLS correction for the case of HET is also known as weighted least
 squares, for this reason.

Multiplicative heteroscedasticity

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose the model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{t} & = & x_{t}^{\prime}\beta+\varepsilon_{t}\\
\sigma_{t}^{2} & = & \mathcal{E}(\varepsilon_{t}^{2})=\left(z_{t}^{\prime}\gamma\right)^{\delta}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 but the other classical assumptions hold.
 In this case 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varepsilon_{t}^{2}=\left(z_{t}^{\prime}\gamma\right)^{\delta}+v_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{t}$
\end_inset

 has mean zero.
 Nonlinear least squares could be used to estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 consistently, were 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 observable.
 The solution is to substitute the squared OLS residuals 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}^{2}$
\end_inset

 in place of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{t}^{2},$
\end_inset

 since it is consistent by the Slutsky theorem.
 Once we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\delta},$
\end_inset

 we can estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{t}^{2}$
\end_inset

 consistently using 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\sigma}_{t}^{2}=\left(z_{t}^{\prime}\hat{\gamma}\right)^{\hat{\delta}}\overset{p}{\rightarrow\sigma_{t}^{2}}.
\]

\end_inset

 In the second step, we transform the model by dividing by the standard
 deviation: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{y_{t}}{\hat{\sigma}_{t}}=\frac{x_{t}^{\prime}\beta}{\hat{\sigma}_{t}}+\frac{\varepsilon_{t}}{\hat{\sigma}_{t}}
\]

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}^{*}=x_{t}^{*\prime}\beta+\varepsilon_{t}^{*}.
\]

\end_inset

 Asymptotically, this model satisfies the classical assumptions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This model is a bit complex in that NLS

 A simpler version would be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{t} & = & x_{t}^{\prime}\beta+\varepsilon_{t}\\
\sigma_{t}^{2} & =\mathcal{E}(\varepsilon_{t}^{2})= & \sigma^{2}z_{t}^{\delta}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{t}$
\end_inset

 is a single variable.
 There are still two parameters to be estimated, and the model of the variance
 is still nonlinear in the parameters.
 However, the 
\emph on

\emph default
 can be used in this case to reduce the estimation problem to repeated applicati

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
First, we define an interval of reasonable values for 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta,$
\end_inset

 e.g., 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\in[0,3].$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Partition this interval into 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\{0,.1,.2,...,2.9,3\}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For each of these values, calculate the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{t}^{\delta_{m}}.$

\begin_layout Itemize
The regression 
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{m},$
\end_inset

 by OLS.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Groupwise heteroscedasticity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common case is where we have repeated observations on each of a number
 of economic agents: e.g., 10 years of macroeconomic data on each of a set
 of countries or regions, or daily observations of transactions of 200 banks.
 This sort of data is a 
\emph on
pooled cross-section time-series model.

\emph default
 It may be reasonable to presume that the variance is constant over time
 within the cross-sectional units, but that it differs across them (e.g.,
 firms or countries of different sizes...).
 The model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{it} & = & x_{it}^{\prime}\beta+\varepsilon_{it}\\
\mathcal{E}(\varepsilon_{it}^{2}) & = & \sigma_{i}^{2},\forall t
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,2,...,G$
\end_inset

 are the agents, and 
\begin_inset Formula $t=1,2,...,n$
\end_inset

 are the observations on each agent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The other classical assumptions are presumed to hold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In this case, the variance 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}^{2}$
\end_inset

 is specific to each agent, but constant over the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 observations for that agent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In this model, we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}(\varepsilon_{it}\varepsilon_{is})=0.$
\end_inset

 This is a strong assumption that we'll relax later.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To correct for heteroscedasticity, just estimate each 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}^{2}$
\end_inset

 using the natural estimator: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\sigma}_{i}^{2}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\hat{\varepsilon}_{it}^{2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Note that we use 
\begin_inset Formula $1/n$
\end_inset

 here since it's possible that there are more than 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 regressors, so 
\begin_inset Formula $n-K$
\end_inset

 could be negative.
 Asymptotically the difference is unimportant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
With each of these, transform the model as usual: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{y_{it}}{\hat{\sigma}_{i}}=\frac{x_{it}^{\prime}\beta}{\hat{\sigma}_{i}}+\frac{\varepsilon_{it}}{\hat{\sigma}_{i}}
\]

\end_inset

 Do this for each cross-sectional group.
 This transformed model satisfies the classical assumptions, asymptotically.

\begin_layout Standard
Autocorrelation, which is the serial correlation of the error term, is a
 problem that is usually associated with time series data, but also can
 affect cross-sectional data.
 For example, a shock to oil prices will simultaneously affect all countries,
 so one could expect contemporaneous correlation of macroeconomic variables
 across countries.

 In a model such as

 Suppose

 One can interpret 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 as a shock that moves the system away from equilibrium.
 If the time needed to return to equilibrium is long with respect to the
 observation frequency, one could expect 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{t+1}$

 to be positive, conditional on 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{t}$

 positive, which induces a correlation.

 Next we discuss two GLS corrections for OLS.
 This sort of solution may lead to inconsistent estimation of betas in some
 cases, and it has definitely gone completely out of style.
 The standard procedure is to include enough lags of the dependent variable
 so that detectable AUT disappears, and then to use robust covariance estimation
 to take care of residual effects (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Subsection
AR(1)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many types of autocorrelation.
 We'll consider two examples.
 The first is the most commonly encountered case: autoregressive order 1
 (AR(1) errors.
 The model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{t} & = & x_{t}^{\prime}\beta+\varepsilon_{t}\\
\varepsilon_{t} & = & \rho\varepsilon_{t-1}+u_{t}\\
u_{t} & \sim & iid(0,\sigma_{u}^{2})\\
\mathcal{E}(\varepsilon_{t}u_{s}) & = & 0,t<s
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 We assume that the model satisfies the other classical assumptions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We need a stationarity assumption: 
\begin_inset Formula $|\rho|<1.$
\end_inset

 Otherwise the variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 explodes as 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 increases, so standard asymptotics will not apply.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
By recursive substitution we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\varepsilon_{t} & = & \rho\varepsilon_{t-1}+u_{t}\\
 & = & \rho\left(\rho\varepsilon_{t-2}+u_{t-1}\right)+u_{t}\\
 & = & \rho^{2}\varepsilon_{t-2}+\rho u_{t-1}+u_{t}\\
 & = & \rho^{2}\left(\rho\varepsilon_{t-3}+u_{t-2}\right)+\rho u_{t-1}+u_{t}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 In the limit the lagged 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 drops out, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{m}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $m\rightarrow\infty,$
\end_inset

 so we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varepsilon_{t}=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\rho^{m}u_{t-m}
\]

\end_inset

 With this, the variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 is found as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{E}(\varepsilon_{t}^{2}) & = & \sigma_{u}^{2}\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\rho^{2m}\\
 & = & \frac{\sigma_{u}^{2}}{1-\rho^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If we had directly assumed that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 were covariance stationary, we could obtain this using 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
V(\varepsilon_{t}) & = & \rho^{2}\mathcal{E}(\varepsilon_{t-1}^{2})+2\rho\mathcal{E}(\varepsilon_{t-1}u_{t})+\mathcal{E}(u_{t}^{2})\\
 & = & \rho^{2}V(\varepsilon_{t})+\sigma_{u}^{2},
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V(\varepsilon_{t})=\frac{\sigma_{u}^{2}}{1-\rho^{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The variance is the 
\begin_inset Formula $0^{th}$
\end_inset

 order autocovariance: 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{0}=V(\varepsilon_{t})$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Note that the variance does not depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Likewise, the first order autocovariance 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Cov(\varepsilon_{t},\varepsilon_{t-1}) & =\gamma_{s}= & \mathcal{E}(\left(\rho\varepsilon_{t-1}+u_{t}\right)\varepsilon_{t-1})\\
 & = & \rho V(\varepsilon_{t})\\
 & = & \frac{\rho\sigma_{u}^{2}}{1-\rho^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Using the same method, we find that for 
\begin_inset Formula $s<t$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Cov(\varepsilon_{t},\varepsilon_{t-s})=\gamma_{s}=\frac{\rho^{s}\sigma_{u}^{2}}{1-\rho^{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The autocovariances don't depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

: the process 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\varepsilon_{t}\}$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
covariance stationary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
correlation (
\emph default
in general, for r.v.'s 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

) is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{corr}(x,y)=\frac{\text{cov}(x,y)}{\text{se}(x)\text{se}(y)}
\]

\end_inset

 but in this case, the two standard errors are the same, so the 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

-order autocorrelation 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{s}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho_{s}=\rho^{s}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All this means that the overall matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 has the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Sigma=\underbrace{\frac{\sigma_{u}^{2}}{1-\rho^{2}}}_{\textrm{this is the variance}}\underbrace{\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
1 & \rho & \rho^{2} & \cdots & \rho^{n-1}\\
\rho & 1 & \rho & \cdots & \rho^{n-2}\\
\vdots &  & \ddots &  & \vdots\\
 &  &  & \ddots & \rho\\
\rho^{n-1} & \cdots &  &  & 1
\end{array}\right]}_{\textrm{this is the correlation matrix}}
\]

\end_inset

 So we have homoscedasticity, but elements off the main diagonal are not
 zero.
 All of this depends only on two parameters, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{u}^{2}.$
\end_inset

 If we can estimate these consistently, we can apply FGLS.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It turns out that it's easy to estimate these consistently.
 The steps are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Estimate the model 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}=x_{t}^{\prime}\beta+\varepsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 by OLS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Take the residuals, and estimate the model 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}=\rho\hat{\varepsilon}_{t-1}+u_{t}^{*}
\]

\end_inset

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}\overset{p}{\rightarrow}\varepsilon_{t},$
\end_inset

 this regression is asymptotically equivalent to the regression 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varepsilon_{t}=\rho\varepsilon_{t-1}+u_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 which satisfies the classical assumptions.
 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\rho}$
\end_inset

 obtained by applying OLS to 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}=\rho\hat{\varepsilon}_{t-1}+u_{t}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is consistent.
 Also, since 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t}^{*}\overset{p}{\rightarrow}u_{t}$
\end_inset

, the estimator 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\sigma}_{u}^{2}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=2}^{n}\left(\hat{u}_{t}^{*}\right)^{2}\overset{p}{\rightarrow}\sigma_{u}^{2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
With the consistent estimators 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\sigma}_{u}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\rho},$
\end_inset

 form 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\Sigma}=\Sigma(\hat{\sigma}_{u}^{2},\hat{\rho})$
\end_inset

 using the previous structure of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma,$
\end_inset

 and estimate by FGLS.
 Actually, one can omit the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\sigma}_{u}^{2}/(1-\rho^{2}),$
\end_inset

 since it cancels out in the formula 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\beta}_{FGLS}=\left(X^{\prime}\hat{\Sigma}^{-1}X\right)^{-1}(X^{\prime}\hat{\Sigma}^{-1}y).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One can iterate the process, by taking the first FGLS estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta,$
\end_inset

 re-estimating 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{u}^{2},$
\end_inset

 etc.
 If one iterates to convergences it's equivalent to MLE (supposing normal
 errors).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An asymptotically equivalent approach is to simply estimate the transformed
 model 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}-\hat{\rho}y_{t-1}=(x_{t}-\hat{\rho}x_{t-1})^{\prime}\beta+u_{t}^{*}
\]

\end_inset

 using 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset

 observations (since 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

 aren't available).
 This is the method of Cochrane and Orcutt.
 Dropping the first observation is asymptotically irrelevant, but 
\emph on
it can be very important in small samples.

\emph default
 One can recuperate the first observation by putting 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{1}^{*} & =y_{1} & \sqrt{1-\hat{\rho}^{2}}\\
x_{1}^{*} & =x_{1} & \sqrt{1-\hat{\rho}^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 This somewhat odd-looking result is related to the Cholesky factorization
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma^{-1}.$
\end_inset

 See Davidson and MacKinnon, pg.
 348-49 for more discussion.
 Note that the variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{u}^{2},$
\end_inset

 asymptotically, so we see that the transformed model will be homoscedastic
 (and nonautocorrelated, since the 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\prime}s$
\end_inset

 are uncorrelated with the 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{\prime}s,$
\end_inset

 in different time periods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
MA(1)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The linear regression model with moving average order 1 errors is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{t} & = & x_{t}^{\prime}\beta+\varepsilon_{t}\\
\varepsilon_{t} & = & u_{t}+\phi u_{t-1}\\
u_{t} & \sim & iid(0,\sigma_{u}^{2})\\
\mathcal{E}(\varepsilon_{t}u_{s}) & = & 0,t<s
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 In this case, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
V(\varepsilon_{t}) & =\gamma_{0}= & \mathcal{E}\left[\left(u_{t}+\phi u_{t-1}\right)^{2}\right]\\
 & = & \sigma_{u}^{2}+\phi^{2}\sigma_{u}^{2}\\
 & = & \sigma_{u}^{2}(1+\phi^{2})
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 Similarly 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\gamma_{1} & = & \mathcal{E}\left[\left(u_{t}+\phi u_{t-1}\right)\left(u_{t-1}+\phi u_{t-2}\right)\right]\\
 & = & \phi\sigma_{u}^{2}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\gamma_{2} & = & \left[\left(u_{t}+\phi u_{t-1}\right)\left(u_{t-2}+\phi u_{t-3}\right)\right]\\
 & = & 0
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 so in this case 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Sigma=\sigma_{u}^{2}\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
1+\phi^{2} & \phi & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
\phi & 1+\phi^{2} & \phi\\
0 & \phi & \ddots &  & \vdots\\
\vdots &  &  & \ddots & \phi\\
0 & \cdots &  & \phi & 1+\phi^{2}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 Note that the first order autocorrelation is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\rho_{1} & =\frac{\phi\sigma_{u}^{2}}{\sigma_{u}^{2}(1+\phi^{2})} & =\frac{\gamma_{1}}{\gamma_{0}}\\
 & = & \frac{\phi}{(1+\phi^{2})}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This achieves a maximum at 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=1$
\end_inset

 and a minimum at 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=-1,$
\end_inset

 and the maximal and minimal autocorrelations are 1/2 and -1/2.
 Therefore, series that are more strongly autocorrelated can't be MA(1)
 processes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again the covariance matrix has a simple structure that depends on only
 two parameters.
 The problem in this case is that one can't estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

\end_inset

 because the 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t}$
\end_inset

 are unobservable and they can't be estimated consistently.
 However, there is a simple way to estimate the parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Since the model is homoscedastic, we can estimate 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V(\varepsilon_{t})=\sigma_{\varepsilon}^{2}=\sigma_{u}^{2}(1+\phi^{2})

\end_inset

 using the typical estimator: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{\sigma_{\varepsilon}^{2}}=\widehat{\sigma_{u}^{2}(1+\phi^{2})}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}^{2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
By the Slutsky theorem, we can interpret this as defining an (unidentified)
 estimator of both 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{u}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi,$
\end_inset

 e.g., use this as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{\sigma_{u}^{2}}(1+\widehat{\phi}^{2})=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}^{2}
\]

\end_inset

 However, this isn't sufficient to define consistent estimators of the parameter
s, since it's unidentified - two unknowns, one equation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To solve this problem, estimate the covariance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 using 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{Cov}(\varepsilon_{t},\varepsilon_{t-1})=\widehat{\phi\sigma_{u}^{2}}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=2}^{n}\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}\hat{\varepsilon}_{t-1}
\]

\end_inset

 This is a consistent estimator, following a LLN (and given that the epsilon
 hats are consistent for the epsilons).
 As above, this can be interpreted as defining an unidentified estimator
 of the two parameters: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\phi}\widehat{\sigma_{u}^{2}}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=2}^{n}\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}\hat{\varepsilon}_{t-1}

 Define the consistent estimator 
\begin_inset Formula

When the form of autocorrelation is unknown, one may decide to use the OLS
 estimator, without correction.
 We've seen that this estimator has the limiting distribution 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\beta}-\beta\right)\overset{d}{\rightarrow}N\left(0,Q_{X}^{-1}\Omega Q_{X}^{-1}\right)

\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Omega=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\mathcal{E}\left(\frac{X^{\prime}\varepsilon\varepsilon^{\prime}X}{n}\right)
\]

\end_inset

 We need a consistent estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

.
 Define 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{t}=x_{t}\varepsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 (recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 is defined as a 
\begin_inset Formula $K\times1$
\end_inset

 vector).
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
X^{\prime}\varepsilon & = & \left[\begin{array}{cccc}

 so that

\end_inset

 We assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{t}$
\end_inset

 is covariance stationary (so that the covariance between 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{t}$

\Gamma_{v}=\mathcal{E}(m_{t}m_{t-v}^{\prime})\neq0

contemporaneously correlated (

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While one could estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 parametrically, we in general have little information upon which to base
 a parametric specification.
 Recent research has focused on consistent nonparametric estimators of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Omega_{n}=\mathcal{E}\frac{1}{n}\left[\left(\sum_{t=1}^{n}m_{t}\right)\left(\sum_{t=1}^{n}m_{t}^{\prime}\right)\right]

\]

\end_inset

 The natural, consistent estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{v}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{\Gamma_{v}}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=v+1}^{n}\hat{m}_{t}\hat{m}_{t-v}^{\prime}.
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula

\hat{m}_{t}=x_{t}\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 (note: one could put 
\begin_inset Formula $1/(n-v)$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/n$
\end_inset

 here).
 So, a natural, but inconsistent, estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{n}$
\end_inset

 would be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\Omega}_{n} & = & \widehat{\Gamma_{0}}+\frac{n-1}{n}\left(\widehat{\Gamma_{1}}+\widehat{\Gamma_{1}^{\prime}}\right)+\frac{n-2}{n}\left(\widehat{\Gamma_{2}}+\widehat{\Gamma_{2}^{\prime}}\right)+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}\left(\widehat{\Gamma_{n-1}}+\widehat{\Gamma_{n-1}^{\prime}}\right)\\
 & = & \widehat{\Gamma_{0}}+\sum_{v=1}^{n-1}\frac{n-v}{n}\left(\widehat{\Gamma_{v}}+\widehat{\Gamma_{v}^{\prime}}\right).
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 This estimator is inconsistent in general, since the number of parameters
 to estimate is more than the number of observations, and increases more
 rapidly than 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $n\rightarrow\infty.$

 a modified estimator

 This estimator is p.d.
 by construction.
 The condition for consistency is that 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-1/4}q(n)\rightarrow0.$
\end_inset

 Note that this is a very slow rate of growth for 
\begin_inset Formula $q.$

\series bold
Breusch-Godfrey test
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This test uses an auxiliary regression, as does the White test for heteroscedast
icity.
 The regression is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}=x_{t}^{\prime}\delta+\gamma_{1}\hat{\varepsilon}_{t-1}+\gamma_{2}\hat{\varepsilon}_{t-2}+\cdots+\gamma_{P}\hat{\varepsilon}_{t-P}+v_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 and the test statistic is the 
\begin_inset Formula $nR^{2}$
\end_inset

 statistic, just as in the White test.
 There are 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 restrictions, so the test statistic is asymptotically distributed as a
 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}(P).$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The intuition is that the lagged errors shouldn't contribute to explaining
 the current error if there is no autocorrelation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 is included as a regressor to account for the fact that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}$
\end_inset

 are not independent even if the 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 are.
 This is a technicality that we won't go into here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This test is valid even if the regressors are stochastic and contain lagged
 dependent variables, so it is considerably more useful than the DW test
 for typical time series data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The alternative is not that the model is an AR(P), following the argument
 above.
 The alternative is simply that some or all of the first 
\begin_inset Formula $P\;$
\end_inset

autocorrelations are different from zero.
 This is compatible with many specific forms of autocorrelation.

Durbin-Watson test
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Durbin-Watson test is not strictly valid in most situations where we
 would like to use it.
 Nevertheless, it is encountered often enough so that one should know something
 about it (perhaps: I'm no longer teaching this, but I'll leave it in the
 notes for reference).
 The Durbin-Watson test statistic is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
DW & = & \frac{\sum_{t=2}^{n}\left(\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}-\hat{\varepsilon}_{t-1}\right)^{2}}{\sum_{t=1}^{n}\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}^{2}}\\
 & = & \frac{\sum_{t=2}^{n}\left(\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}^{2}-2\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}\hat{\varepsilon}_{t-1}+\hat{\varepsilon}_{t-1}^{2}\right)}{\sum_{t=1}^{n}\hat{\varepsilon}_{t}^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The null hypothesis is that the first order autocorrelation of the errors
 is zero: 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}:\rho_{1}=0.$
\end_inset

 The alternative is of course 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{A}:\rho_{1}\neq0.$
\end_inset

 Note that the alternative is not that the errors are AR(1), since many
 general patterns of autocorrelation will have the first order autocorrelation
 different than zero.
 For this reason the test is useful for detecting autocorrelation in general.
 For the same reason, one shouldn't just assume that an AR(1) model is appropria
te when the DW test rejects the null.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Under the null, the middle term tends to zero, and the other two tend to
 one, so 
\begin_inset Formula $DW\overset{p}{\rightarrow}2.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Supposing that we had an AR(1) error process with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=1.$
\end_inset

 In this case the middle term tends to 
\begin_inset Formula $-2,$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $DW\overset{p}{\rightarrow}0$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Supposing that we had an AR(1) error process with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=-1.$
\end_inset

 In this case the middle term tends to 
\begin_inset Formula $2,$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $DW\overset{p}{\rightarrow}4$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
These are the extremes: 
\begin_inset Formula $DW$
\end_inset

 always lies between 0 and 4.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The distribution of the test statistic depends on the matrix of regressors,
 
\begin_inset Formula $X,$
\end_inset

 so tables can't give exact critical values.
 The give upper and lower bounds, which correspond to the extremes that
 are possible.
 See Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Durbin-Watson-critical-values"

\end_inset

.
 There are means of determining exact critical values conditional on 
\begin_inset Formula $X.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Note that DW
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

can be used to test for nonlinearity (add discussion).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The DW test is based upon the assumption that the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is fixed in repeated samples.
 This is often unreasonable in the context of economic time series, which
 is precisely the context where the test would have application.
 It is possible to relate the DW test to other test statistics which are
 valid without strict exogeneity.

\begin_layout Standard
We've seen that the OLS

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

estimator is consistent under autocorrelation, as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $plim\frac{X^{\prime}\varepsilon}{n}=0.$
\end_inset

 This will be the case when 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}(X^{\prime}\varepsilon)$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $=0,$
\end_inset

 following a LLN.
 An important exception is the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 contains lagged 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{\prime}s$
\end_inset

 and the errors are autocorrelated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

Dynamic model with MA1 errors.
 Consider the model 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{t} & = & \alpha+\rho y_{t-1}+\beta x_{t}+\epsilon_{t}\\
\epsilon_{t} & = & \upsilon_{t}+\phi\upsilon_{t-1}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

We can easily see that a regressor is not weakly exogenous: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{E}(y_{t-1}\varepsilon_{t}) & = & \mathcal{E}\left\{ (\alpha+\rho y_{t-2}+\beta x_{t-1}+\upsilon_{t-1}+\phi\upsilon_{t-2})(\upsilon_{t}+\phi\upsilon_{t-1})\right\} \\
 & \neq & 0
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 since one of the terms is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}(\phi\upsilon_{t-1}^{2})$
\end_inset

 which is clearly nonzero.
 In this case 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}(\mathbf{x}_{t}\varepsilon_{t})\neq0,$
\end_inset

 and therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $plim\frac{X^{\prime}\varepsilon}{n}\neq0.$

 Another important case we have not seen yet is that of simultaneous equations.
 The cause is different, but the effect is the same: bias and inconsistency
 when OLS is applied to a single equation.
 The basic idea is presented in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Exogeneity-and-Endogeneity"

\end_inset

.
 A simple regression will estimate the overall effect of x on y.
 If we're interested in the direct effect, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, then we have a problem when the overall effect and the direct effect differ.

Simultaneous equations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Up until now our model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y=X\beta+\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset

where we assume weak exogeneity of the regressors, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $E(x_{t}\epsilon_{t})=0$
\end_inset

.
 With weak exogeneity, the OLS estimator has desirable large sample properties
 (consistency, asymptotic normality).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simultaneous equations is a different prospect.
 An example of a simultaneous equation system is a simple supply-demand
 system: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\text{Demand:\;\ }q_{t} & = & \alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}p_{t}+\alpha_{3}y_{t}+\varepsilon_{1t}\label{eq:demand function}\\
\text{Supply:\;\ }q_{t} & = & \beta_{1}+\beta_{2}p_{t}+\varepsilon_{2t}\nonumber \\
\mathcal{E}\left(\left[\begin{array}{l}
\varepsilon_{1t}\\
\varepsilon_{2t}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{ll}
\varepsilon_{1t} & \varepsilon_{2t}\end{array}\right]\right) & = & \left[\begin{array}{ll}
\sigma_{11} & \sigma_{12}\\
\cdot & \sigma_{22}
\end{array}\right]\nonumber \\
 & \equiv & \Sigma,\forall t\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

 The presumption is that 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}$
\end_inset

 are jointly determined at the same time by the intersection of these equations.
 We'll assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 is determined by some unrelated process.
 It's easy to see that we have correlation between regressors and errors.
 Solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}$
\end_inset

 : 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}p_{t}+\alpha_{3}y_{t}+\varepsilon_{1t} & = & \beta_{1}+\beta_{2}p_{t}+\varepsilon_{2t}\\
\beta_{2}p_{t}-\alpha_{2}p_{t} & = & \alpha_{1}-\beta_{1}+\alpha_{3}y_{t}+\varepsilon_{1t}-\varepsilon_{2t}\\
p_{t} & = & \frac{\alpha_{1}-\beta_{1}}{\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}}+\frac{\alpha_{3}y_{t}}{\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}}+\frac{\varepsilon_{1t}-\varepsilon_{2t}}{\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now consider whether 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}$
\end_inset

 is uncorrelated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{1t}:$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{E}(p_{t}\varepsilon_{1t}) & = & \mathcal{E}\left\{ \left(\frac{\alpha_{1}-\beta_{1}}{\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}}+\frac{\alpha_{3}y_{t}}{\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}}+\frac{\varepsilon_{1t}-\varepsilon_{2t}}{\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}}\right)\varepsilon_{1t}\right\} \\
 & = & \frac{\sigma_{11}-\sigma_{12}}{\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 Because of this correlation, weak exogeneity does not hold, and OLS
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

estimation of the demand equation will be biased and inconsistent.
 The same applies to the supply equation, for the same reason.

In this model,

 These concepts are a bit tricky, and we'll return to it in a minute.
 First, some notation.
 Suppose we group together current endogs in the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{t}.$

 If there are

 Group current and lagged exogs, as well as lagged endogs in the vector
 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$

\begin_inset Formula $K\times1.$
\end_inset

 Stack the errors of the 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 equations into the error vector 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{t}.$
\end_inset

 The model, with additional assumptions, can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
Y_{t}^{\prime}\Gamma & = & X_{t}^{\prime}B+E_{t}^{\prime}\nonumber \\
E_{t} & \sim & N(0,\Sigma),\forall t\label{eq:SIMEQ structural form}\\
\mathcal{E}(E_{t}E_{s}^{\prime}) & = & 0,t\neq s\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

 There are 
\begin_inset Formula $G$

 equations here, and the parameters that enter into each equation are contained
 in the 
\emph on

\emph default
 of the matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 We can stack all

\end_inset

 observations and write the model as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y\Gamma & = & XB+E\\
\mathcal{E}(X^{\prime}E) & = & 0_{(K\times G)}\\

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that the model is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_{t}^{\prime}\Gamma & = & X_{t}^{\prime}B+E_{t}^{\prime}\\
V(E_{t}) & = & \Sigma

\end_inset

 This is the model in

\begin_layout Definition
[Structural form] 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

An equation is in structural form when more than one current period endogenous
 variable is included.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution for the current period endogs is easy to find.
 It is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_{t}^{\prime} & = & X_{t}^{\prime}B\Gamma^{-1}+E_{t}^{\prime}\Gamma^{-1}\\
 & = & X_{t}^{\prime}\Pi+V_{t}^{\prime}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 This is the 
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
[Reduced form] 
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "Reduced form"

\end_inset

An equation is in reduced form if only one current period endog is included.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example is our supply/demand system.
 The reduced form for quantity is obtained by solving the supply equation
 for price and substituting into demand:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
q_{t} & = & \alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}\left(\frac{q_{t}-\beta_{1}-\varepsilon_{2t}}{\beta_{2}}\right)+\alpha_{3}y_{t}+\varepsilon_{1t}\\
\beta_{2}q_{t}-\alpha_{2}q_{t} & = & \beta_{2}\alpha_{1}-\alpha_{2}\left(\beta_{1}+\varepsilon_{2t}\right)+\beta_{2}\alpha_{3}y_{t}+\beta_{2}\varepsilon_{1t}\\
q_{t} & = & \frac{\beta_{2}\alpha_{1}-\alpha_{2}\beta_{1}}{\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}}+\frac{\beta_{2}\alpha_{3}y_{t}}{\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}}+\frac{\beta_{2}\varepsilon_{1t}-\alpha_{2}\varepsilon_{2t}}{\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}}\\
 & = & \pi_{11}+\pi_{21}y_{t}+V_{1t}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 Similarly, the rf for price, as we've seen above, is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{t} & = & \frac{\alpha_{1}-\beta_{1}}{\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}}+\frac{\alpha_{3}y_{t}}{\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}}+\frac{\varepsilon_{1t}-\varepsilon_{2t}}{\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}}\\
 & = & \pi_{12}+\pi_{22}y_{t}+V_{2t}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 The interesting thing about the rf is that the equations individually satisfy
 the classical assumptions, since 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 is uncorrelated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{1t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{2t}$
\end_inset

 by assumption, and therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}(y_{t}V_{it})=0,$
\end_inset

 i=1,2, 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall t.$
\end_inset

 The errors of the rf are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{l}
V_{1t}\\
V_{2t}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{l}
\frac{\beta_{2}\varepsilon_{1t}-\alpha_{2}\varepsilon_{2t}}{\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}}\\
\frac{\varepsilon_{1t}-\varepsilon_{2t}}{\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1t}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
V(V_{1t}) & = & \mathcal{E}\left[\left(\frac{\beta_{2}\varepsilon_{1t}-\alpha_{2}\varepsilon_{2t}}{\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}}\right)\left(\frac{\beta_{2}\varepsilon_{1t}-\alpha_{2}\varepsilon_{2t}}{\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}}\right)\right]\\
 & = & \frac{\beta_{2}^{2}\sigma_{11}-2\beta_{2}\alpha_{2}\sigma_{12}+\alpha_{2}\sigma_{22}}{\left(\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}\right)^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This is constant over time, so the first rf equation is homoscedastic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Likewise, since the 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 are independent over time, so are the 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{t}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The variance of the second rf error is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
V(V_{2t}) & = & \mathcal{E}\left[\left(\frac{\varepsilon_{1t}-\varepsilon_{2t}}{\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}}\right)\left(\frac{\varepsilon_{1t}-\varepsilon_{2t}}{\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}}\right)\right]\\
 & = & \frac{\sigma_{11}-2\sigma_{12}+\sigma_{22}}{\left(\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}\right)^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 and the contemporaneous covariance of the errors across equations is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{E}(V_{1t}V_{2t}) & = & \mathcal{E}\left[\left(\frac{\beta_{2}\varepsilon_{1t}-\alpha_{2}\varepsilon_{2t}}{\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}}\right)\left(\frac{\varepsilon_{1t}-\varepsilon_{2t}}{\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}}\right)\right]\\
 & = & \frac{\beta_{2}\sigma_{11}-\left(\beta_{2}+\alpha_{2}\right)\sigma_{12}+\sigma_{22}}{\left(\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}\right)^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In summary the rf equations individually satisfy the classical assumptions,
 under the assumptions we've made, but they are contemporaneously correlated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general form of the rf is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_{t}^{\prime} & = & X_{t}^{\prime}B\Gamma^{-1}+E_{t}^{\prime}\Gamma^{-1}\\
 & = & X_{t}^{\prime}\Pi+V_{t}^{\prime}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 so we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V_{t}=\left(\Gamma^{-1}\right)^{\prime}E_{t}\sim N\left(0,\left(\Gamma^{-1}\right)^{\prime}\Sigma\Gamma^{-1}\right),\forall t
\]

\end_inset

 and that the 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{t}$
\end_inset

 are timewise independent (note that this wouldn't be the case if the 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{t}$
\end_inset

 were autocorrelated).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the reduced form, we can easily see that the endogenous variables are
 correlated with the structural errors:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
E(E_{t}Y_{t}^{\prime}) & =E\left(E_{t}\left(X_{t}^{\prime}B\Gamma^{-1}+E_{t}^{\prime}\Gamma^{-1}\right)\right)\nonumber \\
 & =E\left(E_{t}X_{t}^{\prime}B\Gamma^{-1}+E_{t}E_{t}^{\prime}\Gamma^{-1}\right)\nonumber \\
 & =\Sigma\Gamma^{-1}\label{eq:correlation between endogs and structural error}

\begin_layout Standard
Assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 has ones on the main diagonal.
 These are normalization restrictions that simply scale the remaining coefficien
ts on each equation, and which scale the variances of the error terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given this scaling and our partitioning, the coefficient matrices can be
 written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Gamma & = & \left[\begin{array}{ll}
1 & \Gamma_{12}\\
-\gamma_{1} & \Gamma_{22}\\
0 & \Gamma_{32}
\end{array}\right]\\
B & = & \left[\begin{array}{ll}

\end{eqnarray*}

With this, the first equation can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
y & = & Y_{1}\gamma_{1}+X_{1}\beta_{1}+\varepsilon\label{eq:single equation from system}\\
 & = & Z\delta+\varepsilon\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

 The problem, as we've seen, is that the columns of 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{1}$
\end_inset

 are correlated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon,$
\end_inset

 because these are endogenous variables, and as we saw in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:correlation between endogs and structural error"

\end_inset

, the endogenous variables are correlated with the structural errors, so
 they don't satisfy weak exogeneity.
 So, 
\begin_inset Formula $E(Z^{\prime}\epsilon)\ne$
\end_inset

0.
 What are the properties of the OLS estimator in this situation?
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\delta} & = & \left(Z^{\prime}Z\right)^{-1}Z^{\prime}y\\
 & = & \left(Z^{\prime}Z\right)^{-1}Z^{\prime}\left(Z\delta^{0}+\varepsilon\right)\\
 & = & \delta^{0}+\left(Z^{\prime}Z\right)^{-1}Z^{\prime}\epsilon
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

It's clear that the OLS estimator is biased in general.
 Also, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\delta}-\delta^{0}=\left(\frac{Z^{\prime}Z}{n}\right)^{-1}\frac{Z^{\prime}\epsilon}{n}
\]

\end_inset

Say that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim\frac{Z^{\prime}\epsilon}{n}=A,$
\end_inset

a.s., and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim\frac{Z^{\prime}Z}{n}=Q_{Z},\,a.s.$
\end_inset

 Then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim\left(\hat{\delta}-\delta^{0}\right)=Q_{Z}^{-1}A\ne0,\,a.s.
\]

\end_inset

So the OLS estimator of a structural equation is inconsistent.
 In general, correlation between regressors and errors leads to this problem,
 whether due to measurement error, simultaneity, or omitted regressors.

\begin_layout Standard
The identification problem in simultaneous equations is in fact of the same
 nature as the identification problem in any estimation setting: does the
 limiting objective function have the proper curvature so that there is
 a unique global minimum or maximum at the true parameter value? In the
 context of IV estimation, this is the case if the limiting covariance of
 the IV estimator is positive definite and 
\begin_inset Formula $plim\frac{1}{n}W^{\prime}\varepsilon=0$
\end_inset

.
 This matrix is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V_{\infty}(\hat{\beta}_{IV})=(Q_{XW}Q_{WW}^{-1}Q_{XW}^{\prime})^{-1}\sigma^{2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The necessary and sufficient condition for identification is simply that
 this matrix be positive definite, and that the instruments be (asymptotically)
 uncorrelated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For this matrix to be positive definite, we need that the conditions noted
 above hold: 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{WW}$
\end_inset

 must be positive definite and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{XW}$
\end_inset

 must be of full rank ( 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 ).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
These identification conditions are not that intuitive nor is it very obvious
 how to check them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Necessary conditions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we use IV estimation for a single equation of the system, the equation
 can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y=Z\delta+\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z=\left[\begin{array}{ll}

\end_inset

 be the total numer of weakly exogenous variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $K^{\ast}=cols(X_{1})\;$
\end_inset

be the number of included exogs, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $K^{\ast\ast}=K-K^{\ast}$

\begin_inset Formula $G^{\ast}=cols(Y_{1})+1$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $G^{\ast\ast}=G-G^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 be the number of excluded endogs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using this notation, consider the selection of instruments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Now the 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}$
\end_inset

 are weakly exogenous and can serve as their own instruments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It turns out that 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 exhausts the set of possible instruments, in that if the variables in 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 don't lead to an identified model then no other instruments will identify
 the model either.
 Assuming this is true (we'll prove it in a moment), then a necessary condition
 for identification is that 
\begin_inset Formula $cols(X_{2})\geq cols(Y_{1})$
\end_inset

 since if not then at least one instrument must be used twice, so 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 will not have full column rank: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho(W)<K^{\ast}+G^{\ast}-1\Rightarrow\rho(Q_{ZW})<K^{\ast}+G^{\ast}-1
\]

\end_inset

 This is the 
\emph on
order condition
\emph default
 for identification in a set of simultaneous equations.
 When the only identifying information is exclusion restrictions on the
 variables that enter an equation, then the number of excluded exogs must
 be greater than or equal to the number of included endogs, minus 1 (the
 normalized lhs endog), e.g., 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K^{\ast\ast}\geq G^{\ast}-1
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To show that this is in fact a necessary condition consider some arbitrary
 set of instruments 
\begin_inset Formula $W.$
\end_inset

 A necessary condition for identification is that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho\left(plim\frac{1}{n}W^{\prime}Z\right)=K^{\ast}+G^{\ast}-1
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
Y_{1} & X_{1}\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 Recall that we've partitioned the model 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y\Gamma=XB+E
\]

\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y=\left[\begin{array}{lll}
y & Y_{1} & Y_{2}\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
X_{1} & X_{2}\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the reduced form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y=X\Pi+V
\]

\end_inset

 we can write the reduced form using the same partition 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{lll}
y & Y_{1} & Y_{2}\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
X_{1} & X_{2}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{lll}
\pi_{11} & \Pi_{12} & \Pi_{13}\\
\pi_{21} & \Pi_{22} & \Pi_{23}
\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{lll}
v & V_{1} & V_{2}\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 so we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y_{1}=X_{1}\Pi_{12}+X_{2}\Pi_{22}+V_{1}
\]

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{n}W^{\prime}Z=\frac{1}{n}W^{\prime}\left[\begin{array}{ll}
X_{1}\Pi_{12}+X_{2}\Pi_{22}+V_{1} & X_{1}\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 Because the 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 's are uncorrelated with the 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

 's, by assumption, the cross between 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

 converges in probability to zero, so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
plim\frac{1}{n}W^{\prime}Z=plim\frac{1}{n}W^{\prime}\left[\begin{array}{ll}
X_{1}\Pi_{12}+X_{2}\Pi_{22} & X_{1}\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 Since the far rhs term is formed only of linear combinations of columns
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $X,$
\end_inset

 the rank of this matrix can never be greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $K,$
\end_inset

 regardless of the choice of instruments.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 has more than 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 columns, then it is not of full column rank.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 has more than 
\begin_inset Formula $K\;$
\end_inset

columns we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G^{*}-1+K^{*}>K
\]

\end_inset

 or noting that 
\begin_inset Formula $K^{**}=K-K^{*},$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G^{*}-1>K^{**}
\]

\end_inset

 In this case, the limiting matrix is not of full column rank, and the identific
ation condition fails.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sufficient conditions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Identification essentially requires that the structural parameters be recoverabl
e from the data.
 This won't be the case, in general, unless the structural model is subject
 to some restrictions.
 We've already identified necessary conditions.
 Turning to sufficient conditions (again, we're only considering identification
 through zero restricitions on the parameters, for the moment).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_{t}^{\prime}\Gamma & = & X_{t}^{\prime}B+E_{t}\\
V(E_{t}) & = & \Sigma
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 This leads to the reduced form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_{t}^{\prime} & = & X_{t}^{\prime}B\Gamma^{-1}+E_{t}\Gamma^{-1}\\
 & = & X_{t}^{\prime}\Pi+V_{t}\\
V(V_{t}) & = & \left(\Gamma^{-1}\right)^{\prime}\Sigma\Gamma^{-1}\\
 & = & \Omega
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 The reduced form parameters are consistently estimable, but none of them
 are known 
\begin_inset Formula $\emph{a}$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
priori,
\emph default
 and there are no restrictions on their values.
 The problem is that more than one structural form has the same reduced
 form, so knowledge of the reduced form parameters alone isn't enough to
 determine the structural parameters.
 To see this, consider the model 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_{t}^{\prime}\Gamma F & = & X_{t}^{\prime}BF+E_{t}F\\
V(E_{t}F) & = & F^{\prime}\Sigma F
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is some arbirary nonsingular 
\begin_inset Formula $G\times G$
\end_inset

 matrix.
 The rf of this new model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_{t}^{\prime} & = & X_{t}^{\prime}BF\left(\Gamma F\right)^{-1}+E_{t}F\left(\Gamma F\right)^{-1}\\
 & = & X_{t}^{\prime}BFF^{-1}\Gamma^{-1}+E_{t}FF^{-1}\Gamma^{-1}\\
 & = & X_{t}^{\prime}B\Gamma^{-1}+E_{t}\Gamma^{-1}\\
 & = & X_{t}^{\prime}\Pi+V_{t}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 Likewise, the covariance of the rf of the transformed model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
V(E_{t}F\left(\Gamma F\right)^{-1}) & = & V(E_{t}\Gamma^{-1})\\
 & = & \Omega
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 Since the two structural forms lead to the same rf, and the rf is all that
 is directly estimable, the models are said to be 
\emph on
observationally equivalent.

\emph default
 What we need for identification are restrictions on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 such that the only admissible 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is an identity matrix (if all of the equations are to be identified).
 Take the coefficient matrices as partitioned before:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{l}
\Gamma\\
B
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
1 & \Gamma_{12}\\
-\gamma_{1} & \Gamma_{22}\\
0 & \Gamma_{32}\\
\beta_{1} & B_{12}\\
0 & B_{22}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 The coefficients of the first equation of the transformed model are simply
 these coefficients multiplied by the first column of 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

.
 This gives 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{l}
\Gamma\\
B
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{l}
f_{11}\\
F_{2}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
1 & \Gamma_{12}\\
-\gamma_{1} & \Gamma_{22}\\
0 & \Gamma_{32}\\
\beta_{1} & B_{12}\\
0 & B_{22}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{l}
f_{11}\\
F_{2}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 For identification of the first equation we need that there be enough restricti
ons so that the only admissible 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{l}
f_{11}\\
F_{2}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 be the leading column of an identity matrix, so that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{ll}
1 & \Gamma_{12}\\
-\gamma_{1} & \Gamma_{22}\\
0 & \Gamma_{32}\\
\beta_{1} & B_{12}\\
0 & B_{22}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{l}
f_{11}\\
F_{2}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{l}
1\\
-\gamma_{1}\\
0\\
\beta_{1}\\
0
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 Note that the third and fifth rows are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{l}
\Gamma_{32}\\
B_{22}
\end{array}\right]F_{2}=\left[\begin{array}{l}
0\\
0
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 Supposing that the leading matrix is of full column rank, e.g., 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho\left(\left[\begin{array}{l}
\Gamma_{32}\\
B_{22}
\end{array}\right]\right)=cols\left(\left[\begin{array}{l}
\Gamma_{32}\\
B_{22}
\end{array}\right]\right)=G-1
\]

\end_inset

 then the only way this can hold, without additional restrictions on the
 model's parameters, is if 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{2}$
\end_inset

 is a vector of zeros.
 Given that 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{2}$
\end_inset

 is a vector of zeros, then the first equation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{ll}
1 & \Gamma_{12}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{l}
f_{11}\\
F_{2}
\end{array}\right]=1\Rightarrow f_{11}=1
\]

\end_inset

 Therefore, as long as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho\left(\left[\begin{array}{l}
\Gamma_{32}\\
B_{22}
\end{array}\right]\right)=G-1
\]

\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{l}
f_{11}\\
F_{2}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{l}
1\\
0_{G-1}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

The first equation is identified in this case, so the condition is sufficient
 for identification.
 It is also necessary, since the condition implies that this submatrix must
 have at least 
\begin_inset Formula $G-1$
\end_inset

 rows.
 Since this matrix has 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G^{\ast\ast}+K^{\ast\ast}=G-G^{\ast}+K^{\ast\ast}
\]

\end_inset

 rows, we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G-G^{\ast}+K^{\ast\ast}\geq G-1
\]

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K^{\ast\ast}\geq G^{\ast}-1
\]

\end_inset

 which is the previously derived necessary condition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above result is fairly intuitive (draw picture here).
 The necessary condition ensures that there are enough variables not in
 the equation of interest to potentially move the other equations, so as
 to trace out the equation of interest.
 The sufficient condition ensures that those other equations in fact do
 move around as the variables change their values.
 Some points:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When an equation has 
\begin_inset Formula $K^{\ast\ast}=G^{\ast}-1,$
\end_inset

 is is 
\emph on
exactly identified
\emph default
, in that omission of an identifiying restriction is not possible without
 loosing consistency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When 
\begin_inset Formula $K^{\ast\ast}>G^{\ast}-1,$
\end_inset

 the equation is 
\emph on
overidentified
\emph default
, since one could drop a restriction and still retain consistency.
 Overidentifying restrictions are therefore testable.
 When an equation is overidentified we have more instruments than are strictly
 necessary for consistent estimation.
 Since estimation by IV with more instruments is more efficient asymptotically,
 one should employ overidentifying restrictions if one is confident that
 they're true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We can repeat this partition for each equation in the system, to see which
 equations are identified and which aren't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
These results are valid assuming that the only identifying information comes
 from knowing which variables appear in which equations, e.g., by exclusion
 restrictions, and through the use of a normalization.
 There are other sorts of identifying information that can be used.
 These include

\begin_layout Enumerate
Cross equation restrictions

\begin_layout Enumerate
Nonlinearities in variables 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
When these sorts of information are available, the above conditions aren't
 necessary for identification, though they are of course still sufficient.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To give an example of how other information can be used, consider the model
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y\Gamma=XB+E
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 is an upper triangular matrix with 1's on the main diagonal.
 This is a 
\emph on
triangular system
\emph default
 of equations.
 In this case, the first equation is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{1}=XB_{\cdot1}+E_{\cdot1}
\]

\end_inset

 Since only exogs appear on the rhs, this equation is identified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second equation is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{2}=-\gamma_{21}y_{1}+XB_{\cdot2}+E_{\cdot2}
\]

\end_inset

 This equation has 
\begin_inset Formula $K^{**}=0$
\end_inset

 excluded exogs, and 
\begin_inset Formula $G^{*}=2$
\end_inset

 included endogs, so it fails the order (necessary) condition for identification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
However, suppose that we have the restriction 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{21}=0,$
\end_inset

 so that the first and second structural errors are uncorrelated.
 In this case 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{E}(y_{1t}\varepsilon_{2t})=\mathcal{E}\left\{ (X_{t}^{\prime}B_{\cdot1}+\varepsilon_{1t})\varepsilon_{2t}\right\} =0
\]

\end_inset

 so there's no problem of simultaneity.
 If the entire 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 matrix is diagonal, then following the same logic, all of the equations
 are identified.
 This is known as a 
\emph on
fully recursive
\emph default
 model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
2SLS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we have no information regarding cross-equation restrictions or the
 structure of the error covariance matrix, one can estimate the parameters
 of a single equation of the system without regard to the other equations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This isn't always efficient, as we'll see, but it has the advantage that
 misspecifications in other equations will not affect the consistency of
 the estimator of the parameters of the equation of interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Also, estimation of the equation won't be affected by identification problems
 in other equations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 2SLS estimator is very simple: it is the GIV estimator, using all of
 the weakly exogenous variables as instruments.
 In the first stage, each column of 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{1}$
\end_inset

 is regressed on 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 the weakly exogenous variables in the system, e.g., the entire 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 matrix.
 The fitted values are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{Y}_{1} & = & X(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}Y_{1}\\
 & = & P_{X}Y_{1}\\
 & = & X\hat{\Pi}_{1}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 Since these fitted values are the projection of 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{1}$
\end_inset

 on the space spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $X,$
\end_inset

 and since any vector in this space is uncorrelated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 by assumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Y}_{1}$
\end_inset

 is uncorrelated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon.$
\end_inset

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Y}_{1}$
\end_inset

 is simply the reduced-form prediction, it is correlated with 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{1},$
\end_inset

 The only other requirement is that the instruments be linearly independent.
 This should be the case when the order condition is satisfied, since there
 are more columns in 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}$
\end_inset

 than in 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{1}$
\end_inset

 in this case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second stage substitutes 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Y}_{1}$
\end_inset

 in place of 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{1},$
\end_inset

 and estimates by OLS.
 This original model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y & = & Y_{1}\gamma_{1}+X_{1}\beta_{1}+\varepsilon\\
 & = & Z\delta+\varepsilon
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 and the second stage model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y=\hat{Y_{1}}\gamma_{1}+X_{1}\beta_{1}+\varepsilon.
\]

\end_inset

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}$
\end_inset

 is in the space spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $X,$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{X}X_{1}=X_{1},$
\end_inset

 so we can write the second stage model as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y & = & P_{X}Y_{1}\gamma_{1}+P_{X}X_{1}\beta_{1}+\varepsilon\\
 & \equiv & P_{X}Z\delta+\varepsilon
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 The OLS estimator applied to this model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\delta}=(Z^{\prime}P_{X}Z)^{-1}Z^{\prime}P_{X}y
\]

\end_inset

 which is exactly what we get if we estimate using IV, with the reduced
 form predictions of the endogs used as instruments.
 Note that if we define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{Z} & = & P_{X}Z\\
 & = & \left[\begin{array}{cc}
\hat{Y}_{1} & X_{1}\end{array}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Z}$
\end_inset

 are the instruments for 
\begin_inset Formula $Z,$
\end_inset

 then we can write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\delta}=(\hat{Z}^{\prime}Z)^{-1}\hat{Z}^{\prime}y
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Important note: OLS on the transformed model can be used to calculate the
 2SLS estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta,$
\end_inset

 since we see that it's equivalent to IV using a particular set of instruments.
 However 
\emph on
the OLS covariance formula is not valid.

\emph default
 We need to apply the IV

\end_inset

covariance formula already seen above.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actually, there is also a simplification of the general IV variance formula.
 Define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{Z} & = & P_{X}Z\\
 & = & \left[\begin{array}{ll}
\hat{Y} & X\end{array}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 The IV
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

covariance estimator would ordinarily be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{V}(\hat{\delta})=\left(\hat{Z}^{\prime}Z\right)^{-1}\left(\hat{Z}^{\prime}\hat{Z}\right)\left(Z^{\prime}\hat{Z}\right)^{-1}\hat{\sigma}_{IV}^{2}
\]

\end_inset

 However, looking at the first term in parentheses
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{Z}^{\prime}Z=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
\hat{Y}_{1} & X_{1}\end{array}\right]^{\prime}\left[\begin{array}{ll}
Y_{1} & X_{1}\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
Y_{1}^{\prime}(P_{X})Y_{1} & Y_{1}^{\prime}(P_{X})X_{1}\\
X_{1}^{\prime}Y_{1} & X_{1}^{\prime}X_{1}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 but since 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{X}$
\end_inset

 is idempotent and since 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{X}X=X,$
\end_inset

 we can write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left[\begin{array}{ll}
\hat{Y}_{1} & X_{1}\end{array}\right]^{\prime}\left[\begin{array}{ll}
Y_{1} & X_{1}\end{array}\right] & = & \left[\begin{array}{ll}
Y_{1}^{\prime}P_{X}P_{X}Y_{1} & Y_{1}^{\prime}P_{X}X_{1}\\
X_{1}^{\prime}P_{X}Y_{1} & X_{1}^{\prime}X_{1}
\end{array}\right]\\
 & = & \left[\begin{array}{ll}
\hat{Y}_{1} & X_{1}\end{array}\right]^{\prime}\left[\begin{array}{ll}
\hat{Y}_{1} & X_{1}\end{array}\right]\\
 & = & \hat{Z}^{\prime}\hat{Z}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 Therefore, the first and second terms in the variance formula cancel, so
 the 2SLS varcov estimator simplifies to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{V}(\hat{\delta})=\left(Z^{\prime}\hat{Z}\right)^{-1}\hat{\sigma}_{IV}^{2}
\]

\end_inset

 which, following some algebra similar to the above, can also be written
 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{V}(\hat{\delta})=\left(\hat{Z}^{\prime}\hat{Z}\right)^{-1}\hat{\sigma}_{IV}^{2}\label{eq:2sls varcov}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Finally, recall that though this is presented in terms of the first equation,
 it is general, since any equation can be placed first.

 A general test for the specification on the model can be formulated as

\begin_layout Standard
The IV

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

estimator can be calculated by applying OLS to the transformed model, so
 the IV objective function at the minimized value is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s(\hat{\beta}_{IV})=\left(y-X\hat{\beta}_{IV}\right)^{\prime}P_{W}\left(y-X\hat{\beta}_{IV}\right),
\]

\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\varepsilon}_{IV} & = & y-X\hat{\beta}_{IV}\\
 & = & y-X(X^{\prime}P_{W}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}P_{W}y\\
 & = & \left(I-X(X^{\prime}P_{W}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}P_{W}\right)y\\
 & = & \left(I-X(X^{\prime}P_{W}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}P_{W}\right)\left(X\beta+\varepsilon\right)\\
 & = & A\left(X\beta+\varepsilon\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A\equiv I-X(X^{\prime}P_{W}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}P_{W}
\]

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s(\hat{\beta}_{IV})=\left(\varepsilon^{\prime}+\beta^{\prime}X^{\prime}\right)A^{\prime}P_{W}A\left(X\beta+\varepsilon\right)
\]

\end_inset

 Moreover, 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{\prime}P_{W}A$
\end_inset

 is idempotent, as can be verified by multiplication: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
A^{\prime}P_{W}A & = & \left(I-P_{W}X(X^{\prime}P_{W}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\right)P_{W}\left(I-X(X^{\prime}P_{W}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}P_{W}\right)\\
 & = & \left(P_{W}-P_{W}X(X^{\prime}P_{W}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}P_{W}\right)\left(P_{W}-P_{W}X(X^{\prime}P_{W}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}P_{W}\right)\\
 & = & \left(I-P_{W}X(X^{\prime}P_{W}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}\right)P_{W}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 Furthermore, 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
AX & = & \left(I-X(X^{\prime}P_{W}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}P_{W}\right)X\\
 & = & X-X\\
 & = & 0
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s(\hat{\beta}_{IV})=\varepsilon^{\prime}A^{\prime}P_{W}A\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset

 Supposing the 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 are normally distributed, with variance 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2},$
\end_inset

 then the random variable 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{s(\hat{\beta}_{IV})}{\sigma^{2}}=\frac{\varepsilon^{\prime}A^{\prime}P_{W}A\varepsilon}{\sigma^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

 is a quadratic form of a 
\begin_inset Formula $N(0,1)$
\end_inset

 random variable with an idempotent matrix in the middle, so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{s(\hat{\beta}_{IV})}{\sigma^{2}}\sim\chi^{2}(\rho(A^{\prime}P_{W}A))
\]

\end_inset

 This isn't available, since we need to estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Substituting a consistent estimator, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{s(\hat{\beta}_{IV})}{\widehat{\sigma^{2}}}\overset{a}{\sim}\chi^{2}(\rho(A^{\prime}P_{W}A))
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Even if the 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 aren't normally distributed, the asymptotic result still holds.
 The last thing we need to determine is the rank of the idempotent matrix.
 We have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A^{\prime}P_{W}A=\left(P_{W}-P_{W}X(X^{\prime}P_{W}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}P_{W}\right)
\]

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\rho(A^{\prime}P_{W}A) & = & Tr\left(P_{W}-P_{W}X(X^{\prime}P_{W}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}P_{W}\right)\\
 & = & TrP_{W}-TrX^{\prime}P_{W}P_{W}X(X^{\prime}P_{W}X)^{-1}\\
 & = & TrW(W^{\prime}W)^{-1}W^{\prime}-K_{X}\\
 & = & TrW^{\prime}W(W^{\prime}W)^{-1}-K_{X}\\
 & = & K_{W}-K_{X}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{W}$
\end_inset

 is the number of columns of 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{X}$
\end_inset

 is the number of columns of 
\begin_inset Formula $X.$
\end_inset

 The degrees of freedom of the test is simply the number of overidentifying
 restrictions: the number of instruments we have beyond the number that
 is strictly necessary for consistent estimation.

 are uncorrelated with

\end_inset

 Rejection can mean that either the model

\begin_layout Standard
On an aside, consider IV estimation of a just-identified model, using the
 standard notation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y=X\beta+\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is the matrix of instruments.
 If we have exact identification then 
\begin_inset Formula $cols(W)=cols(X)$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $W^{'}X$
\end_inset

 is a square matrix.
 The transformed model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{W}y=P_{W}X\beta+P_{W}\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset

 and the fonc are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X^{\prime}P_{W}(y-X\hat{\beta}_{IV})=0
\]

\end_inset

 The IV estimator is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\beta}_{IV}=\left(X^{\prime}P_{W}X\right)^{-1}X^{\prime}P_{W}y
\]

\end_inset

 Considering the inverse here 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left(X^{\prime}P_{W}X\right)^{-1} & = & \left(X^{\prime}W(W^{\prime}W)^{-1}W^{\prime}X\right)^{-1}\\
 & = & (W^{\prime}X)^{-1}\left(X^{\prime}W(W^{\prime}W)^{-1}\right)^{-1}\\
 & = & (W^{\prime}X)^{-1}(W^{\prime}W)\left(X^{\prime}W\right)^{-1}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 Now multiplying this by 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{\prime}P_{W}y,$
\end_inset

 we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\beta}_{IV} & = & (W^{\prime}X)^{-1}(W^{\prime}W)\left(X^{\prime}W\right)^{-1}X^{\prime}P_{W}y\\
 & = & (W^{\prime}X)^{-1}(W^{\prime}W)\left(X^{\prime}W\right)^{-1}X^{\prime}W(W^{\prime}W)^{-1}W^{\prime}y\\
 & = & (W^{\prime}X)^{-1}W^{\prime}y
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 The objective function for the generalized IV estimator is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
s(\hat{\beta}_{IV}) & = & \left(y-X\hat{\beta}_{IV}\right)^{\prime}P_{W}\left(y-X\hat{\beta}_{IV}\right)\\
 & = & y^{\prime}P_{W}\left(y-X\hat{\beta}_{IV}\right)-\hat{\beta}_{IV}^{\prime}X^{\prime}P_{W}\left(y-X\hat{\beta}_{IV}\right)\\
 & = & y^{\prime}P_{W}\left(y-X\hat{\beta}_{IV}\right)-\hat{\beta}_{IV}^{\prime}X^{\prime}P_{W}y+\hat{\beta}_{IV}^{\prime}X^{\prime}P_{W}X\hat{\beta}_{IV}\\
 & = & y^{\prime}P_{W}\left(y-X\hat{\beta}_{IV}\right)-\hat{\beta}_{IV}^{\prime}\left(X^{\prime}P_{W}y+X^{\prime}P_{W}X\hat{\beta}_{IV}\right)\\
 & = & y^{\prime}P_{W}\left(y-X\hat{\beta}_{IV}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 by the fonc for generalized IV.
 However, when we're in the just indentified case, this is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
s(\hat{\beta}_{IV}) & = & y^{\prime}P_{W}\left(y-X(W^{\prime}X)^{-1}W^{\prime}y\right)\\
 & = & y^{\prime}P_{W}\left(I-X(W^{\prime}X)^{-1}W^{\prime}\right)y\\
 & = & y^{\prime}\left(W(W^{\prime}W)^{-1}W^{\prime}-W(W^{\prime}W)^{-1}W^{\prime}X(W^{\prime}X)^{-1}W^{\prime}\right)y\\
 & = & 0
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 
\emph on
The value of the objective function of the IV estimator is zero in the just
 identified case.

\emph default
 This makes sense, since we've already shown that the objective function
 after dividing by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 is asymptotically 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 with degrees of freedom equal to the number of overidentifying restrictions.
 In the present case, there are no overidentifying restrictions, so we have
 a 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}(0)$
\end_inset

 rv, which has mean 0 and variance 0, e.g., it's simply 0.
 This means we're not able to test the identifying restrictions in the case
 of exact identification.

\begin_layout Section
System methods of estimation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2SLS is a single equation method of estimation, as noted above.
 The advantage of a single equation method is that it's unaffected by the
 other equations of the system, so they don't need to be specified (except
 for defining what are the exogs, so 2SLS can use the complete set of instrument
s).
 The disadvantage of 2SLS is that it's inefficient, in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Recall that overidentification improves efficiency of estimation, since
 an overidentified equation can use more instruments than are necessary
 for consistent estimation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Secondly, the assumption is that 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y\Gamma & = & XB+E\\
\mathcal{E}(X^{\prime}E) & = & 0_{(K\times G)}\\
vec(E) & \sim & N(0,\Psi)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Since there is no autocorrelation of the 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{t}$
\end_inset

 's, and since the columns of 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 are individually homoscedastic, then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Psi & = & \left[\begin{array}{llll}
\sigma_{11}I_{n} & \sigma_{12}I_{n} & \cdots & \sigma_{1G}I_{n}\\
 & \sigma_{22}I_{n} &  & \vdots\\
 &  & \ddots & \vdots\\
\cdot &  &  & \sigma_{GG}I_{n}
\end{array}\right]\\
 & = & \Sigma\otimes I_{n}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 This means that the structural equations are heteroscedastic and correlated
 with one another
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In general, ignoring this will lead to inefficient estimation, following
 the section on GLS.
 When equations are correlated with one another estimation should account
 for the correlation in order to obtain efficiency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Also, since the equations are correlated, information about one equation
 is implicitly information about all equations.
 Therefore, overidentification restrictions in any equation improve efficiency
 for 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 equations, even the just identified equations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Single equation methods can't use these types of information, and are therefore
 inefficient (in general).

 I no longer teach the following section, but it is retained for its possible

 The 2SLS and 3SLS estimators don't require distributional assumptions,

 Our model is, recall 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_{t}^{\prime}\Gamma & = & X_{t}^{\prime}B+E_{t}^{\prime}\\

 The joint normality of 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{t}$

 means that the density for 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{t}$

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(2\pi)^{-g/2}\left(\det\Sigma^{-1}\right)^{-1/2}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}E_{t}^{\prime}\Sigma^{-1}E_{t}\right)

 The transformation from 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{t}$

\begin_inset Formula $Y_{t}$
\end_inset

 requires the Jacobian 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
|\det\frac{dE_{t}}{dY_{t}'}|=|\det\Gamma|
\]

\end_inset

 so the density for 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{t}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(2\pi)^{-G/2}|\det\Gamma|\left(\det\Sigma^{-1}\right)^{-1/2}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(Y_{t}^{\prime}\Gamma-X_{t}^{\prime}B\right)\Sigma^{-1}\left(Y_{t}^{\prime}\Gamma-X_{t}^{\prime}B\right)^{\prime}\right)

 Given the assumption of independence over time, the joint log-likelihood

\begin_inset Formula

\ln L(B,\Gamma,\Sigma)=-\frac{nG}{2}\ln(2\pi)+n\ln(|\det\Gamma|)-\frac{n}{2}\ln\det\Sigma^{-1}-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left(Y_{t}^{\prime}\Gamma-X_{t}^{\prime}B\right)\Sigma^{-1}\left(Y_{t}^{\prime}\Gamma-X_{t}^{\prime}B\right)^{\prime}

To give a practical example, consider the following (old-fashioned, but
 illustrative) macro model (this is the widely known Klein's Model 1) 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{Consumption:\;\ }C_{t} & = & \alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1}P_{t}+\alpha_{2}P_{t-1}+\alpha_{3}(W_{t}^{p}+W_{t}^{g})+\varepsilon_{1t}\\

 & \sigma_{22} & \sigma_{23}\\
 &  & \sigma_{33}
\end{array}\right)\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 The other variables are the government wage bill, 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{t}^{g},$

 taxes, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{t},$
\end_inset

 government nonwage spending, 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{t},$
\end_inset

and a time trend, 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}.$
\end_inset

 The endogenous variables are the lhs variables, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y_{t}^{\prime}=\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}
C_{t} & I_{t} & W_{t}^{p} & X_{t} & P_{t} & K_{t}\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 and the predetermined variables are all others: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X_{t}^{\prime}=\left[\begin{array}{cccccccc}
1 & W_{t}^{g} & G_{t} & T_{t} & A_{t} & P_{t-1} & K_{t-1} & X_{t-1}\end{array}\right].

\end_inset

 The model assumes that the errors of the equations are contemporaneously
 correlated, but nonautocorrelated.
 The model written as 
\begin_inset Formula $Y\Gamma=XB+E$
\end_inset

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Gamma=\left[\begin{array}{llllll}

 To check this identification of the consumption equation, we need to extract
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{32}$

\begin_inset Formula $B_{22},$
\end_inset

 the submatrices of coefficients of endogs and exogs that 
\emph on

 These are the rows that have zeros in the first column, and we need to
 drop the first column.
 We get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{l}
\Gamma_{32}\\
B_{22}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{lllll}
1 & 0 & -1 & 0 & -1\\

 We need to find a set of 5 rows of this matrix gives a full-rank 5

 For example, selecting rows 3,4,5,6, and 7 we obtain the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A=\left[\begin{array}{lllll}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0\\
0 & \gamma_{3} & 0 & 0 & 0\\
\beta_{3} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 This matrix is of full rank, so the sufficient condition for identification
 is met.
 Counting included endogs, 
\begin_inset Formula $G^{\ast}=3,$
\end_inset

 and counting excluded exogs, 
\begin_inset Formula $K^{\ast\ast}=5,$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
K^{\ast\ast}-L & =G^{\ast}-1\\
5-L & =3-1\\
L & =3
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The equation is over-identified by three restrictions, according to the

 However, there is additional information in this case.
 Both

\begin_inset Formula $W_{t}^{g}$

 be the same.
 For this reason the consumption equation is in fact overidentified by four
 restrictions.

The above results are not valid (specifically, they are inconsistent) if

 be valid instruments in that case.
 You might consider eliminating the lagged endogenous variables as instruments,

 this more complex case.
 Standard errors will still be estimated inconsistently, unless use a Newey-West

Newton's method

\begin_layout Standard
Newton's method uses information about the slope and curvature of the objective
 function to determine which direction and how far to move from an initial
 point.
 Supposing we're trying to maximize 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}(\theta).$
\end_inset

 Take a second order Taylor's series approximation of 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}(\theta)$
\end_inset

 about 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{k}$
\end_inset

 (an initial guess).
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{n}(\theta)\approx s_{n}(\theta^{k})+g(\theta^{k})^{\prime}\left(\theta-\theta^{k}\right)+1/2\left(\theta-\theta^{k}\right)^{\prime}H(\theta^{k})\left(\theta-\theta^{k}\right)
\]

\end_inset

(
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is the gradient vector and 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is the Hessian matrix).
 To attempt to maximize 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}(\theta),$
\end_inset

 we can maximize the portion of the right-hand side that depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta,$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default
, we can maximize 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{s}(\theta)=g(\theta^{k})^{\prime}\theta+1/2\left(\theta-\theta^{k}\right)^{\prime}H(\theta^{k})\left(\theta-\theta^{k}\right)
\]

\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta.$
\end_inset

 This is a much easier problem, since it is a quadratic function in 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta,$
\end_inset

 so it has linear first order conditions.
 These are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D_{\theta}\tilde{s}(\theta)=g(\theta^{k})+H(\theta^{k})\left(\theta-\theta^{k}\right)

\theta^{k+1}=\theta^{k}-H(\theta^{k})^{-1}g(\theta^{k})

A potential problem is that the Hessian may not be negative definite when
 we're far from the maximizing point.
 So 
\begin_inset Formula $-H(\theta^{k})^{-1}$
\end_inset

 may not be positive definite, and 
\begin_inset Formula $-H(\theta^{k})^{-1}g(\theta^{k})$
\end_inset

 may not define an increasing direction of search.
 This can happen when the objective function has flat regions, in which
 case the Hessian matrix is very ill-conditioned (e.g., is nearly singular),
 or when we're in the vicinity of a local minimum, 
\begin_inset Formula $H(\theta^{k})$
\end_inset

 is positive definite, and our direction is a 
\emph on
decreasing
\emph default
 direction of search.
 Matrix inverses by computers are subject to large errors when the matrix
 is ill-conditioned.
 Also, we certainly don't want to go in the direction of a minimum when
 we're maximizing.
 To solve this problem, 
\emph on
Quasi-Newton
\emph default
 methods simply add a positive definite component to 
\begin_inset Formula $H(\theta)$
\end_inset

 to ensure that the resulting matrix is positive definite, 
\emph on
e.g.,
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=-H(\theta)+b\mathbf{I},$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is chosen large enough so that 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is well-conditioned and positive definite.
 This has the benefit that improvement in the objective function is guaranteed.

Another variation of quasi-Newton methods is to approximate the Hessian

 This avoids actual calculation of the Hessian, which is an order of magnitude

Simulated Annealing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simulated annealing is an algorithm which can find an optimum in the presence
 of nonconcavities, discontinuities and multiple local minima/maxima.
 Basically, the algorithm randomly selects evaluation points, accepts all
 points that yield an increase in the objective function, but also accepts
 some points that decrease the objective function.
 This allows the algorithm to escape from local minima.
 As more and more points are tried, periodically the algorithm focuses on
 the best point so far, and reduces the range over which random points are
 generated.
 Also, the probability that a negative move is accepted reduces.
 The algorithm relies on many evaluations, as in the search method, but
 focuses in on promising areas, which reduces function evaluations with
 respect to the search method.
 It does not require derivatives to be evaluated.

Demand for health care is usually thought of a a derived demand: health
 care is an input to a home production function that produces health, and
 health is an argument of the utility function.
 Grossman (1972), for example, models health as a capital stock that is
 subject to depreciation (e.g., the effects of ageing).
 Health care visits restore the stock.
 Under the home production framework, individuals decide when to make health
 care visits to maintain their health stock, or to deal with negative shocks
 to the stock in the form of accidents or illnesses.
 As such, individual demand will be a function of the parameters of the
 individuals' utility functions.

\begin_layout Standard
All of the measures of use are count data, which means that they take on
 the values 
\begin_inset Formula ${0,1,2,...}$
\end_inset

.
 It might be reasonable to try to use this information by specifying the
 density as a count data density.
 One of the simplest count data densities is the Poisson density, which
 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
f_{Y}(y) & = & \frac{\exp(-\lambda)\lambda^{y}}{y!}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

For this density, 
\begin_inset Formula $E(Y)=V(Y)=\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 The Poisson average log-likelihood function is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{n}(\theta)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(-\lambda_{i}+y_{i}\ln\lambda_{i}-\ln y_{i}!\right)
\]

\end_inset

We will parameterize the model as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\lambda_{i} & = & \exp(\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\prime}\beta)\nonumber \\
\mathbf{x}_{i} & = & [1\,\,PUBLIC\,\,PRIV\,\,SEX\,\,AGE\,\,EDUC\,\,INC]^{\prime}\label{eq:Poisson model OBDV}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

This ensures that the mean is positive, as is required for the Poisson model,
 and now the mean (and the variance) depend upon explanatory variables.
 Note that for this parameterization
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial\lambda}{\partial x_{j}}=\lambda\beta_{j}
\]

\end_inset

so
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\beta_{j}x_{j}=\frac{\partial\lambda}{\partial x_{j}}\frac{x_{j}}{\lambda}=\eta_{x_{j}}^{\lambda},

\begin_layout Subsection
Poor scaling of the data

, the data will not be scaled, and the estimation program will have difficulty
 converging (note that the likelihood value is lower with poor scaling).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Multiple optima
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multiple optima (one global, others local) can complicate life, since we
 have limited means of determining if there is a higher maximum than the
 one we're at.
 Think of climbing a mountain in an unknown range, in a very foggy place.
 A nice picture is Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, but try to imagine the scene if the clouds were 2000m thicker.
 A representation is Figure

\end_inset

).
 You can go up until there's nowhere else to go up, but since you're in
 the fog you don't know if the true summit is across the gap that's at your
 feet.
 Do you claim victory and go home, or do you trudge down the gap and explore
 the other side? (example inspired by H.W.
 Tilman 
\emph on
Snow on the Equator).

\begin_layout Standard
The best way to avoid stopping at a local maximum is to use many starting
 values, for example on a grid, or randomly generated.
 Or perhaps one might have priors about possible values for the parameters
 (
\emph on
e.g.,
\emph default
 from previous studies of similar data).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's try to find the true minimizer of minus 1 times the foggy mountain
 function (since the algorithms are set up to minimize).
 From the picture, you can see it's close to 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,0)$
\end_inset

, but let's pretend there is fog, and that we don't know that.

 shows that poor start values can lead to problems.
 It uses SA, which finds the true global minimum, and it shows that BFGS
 using a battery of random start values can also find the global minimum
 help.
 The output of one run is here: 
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand verbatiminput
filename "Examples/NonlinearOptimization/FoggyMountain.out"

\end_inset

In that run, the single BFGS run with bad start values converged to a point
 far from the true minimizer, while simulated annealing found the true minimizer.
 BFGS using multiple start values also gets the correct solution, and if
 you check, you'll find that it's faster than SA.
 The moral of the story is to be cautious and don't publish your results
 too quickly.

Extremum estimators

\begin_layout Standard
We'll begin with study of 
\emph on
extremum estimators
\emph default
 in general.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Z}_{n}=\left\{ z_{1},z_{2},...,z_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 be the available data, arranged in a 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times p$
\end_inset

 matrix, based on a sample of size 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 (there are 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 variables).
 Our paradigm is that data are generated as a draw from the joint density
 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{Z_{n}}(z)$
\end_inset

.
 This density may not be known, but it exists in principle.
 The draw from the density may be thought of as the outcome of a random
 experiment that is characterized by the probability space 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \Omega,\mathcal{F},P\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 When the experiment is performed, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in\Omega$
\end_inset

 is the result, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Z}_{n}(\omega)=\left\{ Z_{1}(\omega),Z_{2}(\omega),...,Z_{n}(\omega)\right\} =\left\{ z_{1},z_{2},...,z_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is the realized data.
 The probability space is rich enough to allow us to consider events defined
 in terms of an infinite sequence of data

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{n}=\left(\begin{array}{llll}

\end_inset

 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Z}_{n}=[\mathbf{y}_{n}\,\mathbf{X}_{n}]$

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}=(\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{y},$

 This illustrates the idea that an extremum estimator minimizes or maximizes
 a function, and that the estimate and parameters that we are trying to
 estimate are distinct points.
 As the sample gets large, the two points get close together, if the estimator
 is consistent.

\begin_layout Example
Maximum likelihood.
 Suppose that the continuous random variables 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{t}\sim IIN(\mu^{0},\sigma_{0}^{2}),\,t=1,2,...,n$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 is a standard normal random variable, its density is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{\epsilon}(z)=\left(2\pi\right)^{-1/2}\exp\left(-\frac{z^{2}}{2}\right).
\]

\end_inset

 We have that 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{t}=(Y_{t}-\mu_{0})/\sigma_{0}$
\end_inset

 is standard normal, and the Jacobian 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\partial\epsilon_{t}/\partial y_{t}\right|=1/\sigma_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, doing a change of variable, the density of a single observation on
 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{Y}(y_{t};\theta)=\left(2\pi\right)^{-1/2}(1/\sigma)\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{y_{t}-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{2}\right).
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=(\mu,\sigma$
\end_inset

).
 The maximum likelihood estimator is maximizes the joint density of the
 sample.
 Because the data are i.i.d., the joint density of the sample 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is the product of the densities of each observation, and the ML estimator
 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\theta}\equiv\arg\max_{\Theta}\,\,\mathcal{L}_{n}(\theta)=\prod_{t=1}^{n}f_{Y}(y_{t};\theta)
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset

Because the natural logarithm is strictly increasing on 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,\infty)$
\end_inset

, maximization of the average logarithmic likelihood function is achieved
 at the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}$
\end_inset

 as for the likelihood function.
 So, the ML estimator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}\equiv\arg\max_{\Theta}s_{n}(\theta)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
s_{n}(\theta) & =\left(1/n\right)\ln\mathcal{L}_{n}(\theta)=\left(1/n\right)\sum_{t=1}^{n}\ln f_{Y}(y_{t};\theta)\\
 & =-\ln\sqrt{2\pi}-\text{\log}\sigma-\left(1/n\right)\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left(\frac{y_{t}-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{2}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Solution of the f.o.c.
 leads to the familiar result that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}=\bar{\mathbf{y}}.$
\end_inset

 We'll come back to this in more detail later.

\begin_layout Example
(reminder to self in lectures: that squiggle is a

\end_inset

) Bayesian point estimators such as the posterior mode, median or mean can
 be expressed as extremum estimators.
 For example, the posterior mean 
\begin_inset Formula $E(\theta|Z_{n})$
\end_inset

 is the minimizer (with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

) of the function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{n}(\zeta)=\int_{\Theta}\left(\theta-\zeta\right)^{2}f(Z_{n};\theta)\pi(\theta)/f(Z_{n})d\theta
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $f(Z_{n};\theta)$
\end_inset

 is the likelihood function, 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(\theta)$
\end_inset

 is a prior density, and 
\begin_inset Formula $f(Z_{n})$
\end_inset

 is the marginal likelihood of the data.
 These concepts are explained later, for now the point is that Bayesian
 estimators can be thought of as extremum estimators, and the theory for
 extremum estimators will apply.

Note that the objective function

\begin_layout Itemize
We need to consider what happens as different outcomes 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in\Omega$
\end_inset

 occur.
 These different outcomes lead to different data being generated, and the
 different data causes the objective function to change.
 
\end_layout

Note, however, that for a fixed

\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}(\mathbf{Z}_{n},\theta)$
\end_inset

 becomes a non-random function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$

\begin_layout Itemize
When actually 
\emph on
computing
\emph default
 an extremum estimator, we condition on the observed data, and treat it
 as fixed.
 Then we compute estimators either by solving the f.o.c., as in the case of
 OLS, or if that is not possible, by employing algorithms for optimization
 of nonstochastic functions.
 How to do this is the topic of Chapter

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$

\end_inset

 that generated the observed data.
 This is because we would like to find estimators that work well on average
 for any data set that can result from 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in\Omega$
\end_inset

\end_inset

 or simply 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}(\theta)$
\end_inset

, depending on context.
 The first of these emphasizes the fact that the objective function is random,
 and the second is more compact.
 However, the data is still in there, and because the data is randomly sampled,
 the objective function is random, too.

 In some cases of interest,

 Nevertheless, it may still converge to a continuous function, in which

Proof:
\series default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Select a 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in\Omega$
\end_inset

 and hold it fixed.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ s_{n}(\omega,\theta)\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a fixed sequence of functions.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is such that 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}(\omega,\theta)$
\end_inset

 converges to 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{\infty}(\theta).$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\hat{\theta}_{n}\}$
\end_inset

 lies in the compact set 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\Theta},$
\end_inset

 by assumption (a) and the fact that maximization is over 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\Theta}$
\end_inset

.
 Since every sequence from a compact set has at least one limit point (Bolzano-W
eierstrass), say that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}$
\end_inset

 is a limit point of 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\hat{\theta}_{n}\}.$
\end_inset

 As such, there is a subsequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\hat{\theta}_{n_{m}}\}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\{n_{m}\}$
\end_inset

 is simply a sequence of increasing integers) with 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{m\rightarrow\infty}\hat{\theta}_{n_{m}}=\hat{\theta}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
By uniform convergence and continuity of the limiting objective function,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{m\rightarrow\infty}s_{n_{m}}(\hat{\theta}_{n_{m}})=s_{\infty}(\hat{\theta}).
\]

\end_inset

 To see this, first of all, select an element 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}_{t}$
\end_inset

 from the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \hat{\theta}_{n_{m}}\right\} .$
\end_inset

 Then uniform convergence (assn.
 b) implies 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{m\rightarrow\infty}s_{n_{m}}(\hat{\theta}_{t})=s_{\infty}(\hat{\theta}_{t})
\]

\end_inset

Continuity of 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{\infty}\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 implies that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}s_{\infty}(\hat{\theta}_{t})=s_{\infty}(\hat{\theta})
\]

\end_inset

 since the limit as 
\begin_inset Formula $t\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \hat{\theta}_{t}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}$
\end_inset

.
 So the above claim is true.
\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Next, by maximization 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{n_{m}}(\hat{\theta}_{n_{m}})\geq s_{n_{m}}(\theta^{0})
\]

\end_inset

 which holds in the limit, so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{m\rightarrow\infty}s_{n_{m}}(\hat{\theta}_{n_{m}})\geq\lim_{m\rightarrow\infty}s_{n_{m}}(\theta^{0}).
\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
However, for the left hand side, the previous slide showed that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{m\rightarrow\infty}s_{n_{m}}(\hat{\theta}_{n_{m}})=s_{\infty}(\hat{\theta}),
\]

\end_inset

 For the right hand side, a similar argument gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{m\rightarrow\infty}s_{n_{m}}(\theta^{0})=s_{\infty}(\theta^{0})
\]

\end_inset

 by uniform convergence, so the above inequality can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{\infty}(\hat{\theta})\geq s_{\infty}(\theta^{0}).
\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
But by assumption (c), there is a unique global maximum of 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{\infty}(\theta)$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{0},$
\end_inset

 so we must have 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{\infty}(\hat{\theta})=s_{\infty}(\theta^{0}),$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}=\theta^{0}$
\end_inset

 , in the limit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Finally, so far we have held 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 fixed, but now we need to consider all 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in\Omega$
\end_inset

.
 All of the above limits hold almost surely, by assumption (b).
  Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\hat{\theta}_{n}\}$
\end_inset

 has only one limit point, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{0},$
\end_inset

 except on a set 
\begin_inset Formula $C\subset\Omega$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $P(C)=0.$

Discussion of the proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}_{n}$

\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}\left(\theta\right).$
\end_inset

 It is not required to be unique for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 finite, though the identification assumption requires that the limiting
 objective function have a unique maximizing argument.
 The previous section on numeric optimization methods showed that actually
 finding the global maximum of 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}\left(\theta\right)$
\end_inset

 may be a non-trivial problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
See Amemiya's Example 4.1.4 for a case where discontinuity leads to breakdown
 of consistency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
uniform convergence is needed, so that the maximum of

\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}.$

 If the objective function is not converging at 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{*},$

 there's no guarantee that 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}(\theta_{*})$
\end_inset

 will be lower than 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{\infty}(\theta_{0})$

The assumption that

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$

 such as 
\begin_inset Formula

s_{n}(\theta)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}s_{t}(\theta)

\end_inset

As long as the

 Now we have two parameters to worry about, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 We are probably interested in learning about the true DGP, which means
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{0}$
\end_inset

 is the item of interest.
 When the DGP is parametric, the limiting objective function is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{\infty}(\theta)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\mathcal{E}s_{n}(Z_{n},\theta)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int_{\mathcal{Z}_{n}}s_{n}(z,\theta)f_{Z_{n}}(z;\rho^{0})dz
\]

\end_inset

and we can write the limiting objective function as 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{\infty}(\theta,\rho^{0})$
\end_inset

 to emphasize the dependence on the parameter of the DGP.
 From the theorem, we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}_{n}\stackrel{a.s.}{\rightarrow}\theta^{0}$

\begin_layout Section
Example: Inconsistency of Misspecified Least Squares
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You already know that the OLS estimator is inconsistent when relevant variables
 are omitted.
 Let's verify this result in the context of extremum estimators.
 We suppose that data is generated by random sampling of 
\begin_inset Formula $(Y,X)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}=\beta_{0}x_{t}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $+\varepsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(X,\varepsilon\right)$
\end_inset

 has the common distribution function 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{Z}=\mu_{x}\mu_{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 are independent) with support 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{Z=X}\times\mathcal{E}.$
\end_inset

 Suppose that the variances 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{X}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\varepsilon}^{2}$
\end_inset

 are finite.
 However, the econometrician is unaware of the true DGP, and instead proposes
 the misspecified model 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}=\gamma_{0}w_{t}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $+\eta_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $E(W\epsilon)=0$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $E(WX)\ne0.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sample objective function for a sample size 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
s_{n}(\gamma) & = & 1/n\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left(y_{t}-\gamma w_{t}\right)^{2}=1/n\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\beta_{0}x_{t}+\varepsilon_{t}-\gamma w_{t}\right)^{2}\\
 & = & 1/n\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left(\beta_{0}x_{t}\right)^{2}+1/n\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left(\gamma w_{t}\right)^{2}+1/n\sum_{t=1}^{n}\varepsilon_{t}^{2}\\
 &  & +2/n\sum_{t=1}^{n}\beta_{0}x_{t}\varepsilon_{t}-2/n\sum_{t=1}^{n}\beta_{0}\gamma x_{t}w_{t}-2/n\sum_{t=1}^{n}\varepsilon_{t}x_{t}w_{t},
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

which one can verify if armed with patience.
 Using arguments similar to the correctly specified case, above, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{\infty}(\gamma)=\gamma^{2}E\left(W^{2}\right)-2\beta_{0}\gamma E(WX)+C
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 holds all terms that do not depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

.
 So, finding the minimizer with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, we get 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{0}=\frac{\beta_{0}E(WX)}{E(W^{2})}$
\end_inset

, which is the true parameter of the DGP, multiplied by the pseudo-true
 value of a regression of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $W.$
\end_inset

 The OLS estimator is not consistent for the true parameter, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The theorem for consistency is really quite intuitive.
 It says that, with probability one, an extremum estimator converges to
 the value that maximizes the limit of the expectation of the objective
 function.
 Because the objective function may or may not make sense, depending on
 how good or poor is the model, we may or may not be estimating parameters
 of the DGP.

We'll study this more later, but for now it is clear that the foc for minimizati

 A common approach to the problem seeks to avoid this difficulty by 
\emph on
linearizing

 the model.
 A first order Taylor's series expansion about the point 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$

 with remainder gives 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{i}=h(x^{0},\theta^{0})+\left(x_{i}-x_{0}\right)^{\prime}\frac{\partial h(x_{0},\theta^{0})}{\partial x}+\nu_{i}

\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{i}$

\begin_layout Itemize

The answer is no, as one can see by interpreting

 and

 as extremum estimators.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=(\alpha,\beta^{\prime})^{\prime}.$

 The objective function converges to its expectation 
\begin_inset Formula

s_{n}(\gamma)\stackrel{u.a.s.}{\rightarrow}s_{\infty}(\gamma)=\mathcal{E}_{X}\mathcal{E}_{Y|X}\left(y-\alpha-\beta x\right)^{2}

 converges 
\begin_inset Formula $a.s.$

 to the

\begin_inset Formula $s_{\infty}(\gamma)$

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma^{0}=\arg\min\mathcal{E}_{X}\mathcal{E}_{Y|X}\left(y-\alpha-\beta x\right)^{2}

\end_inset

 Noting that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{E}_{X}\mathcal{E}_{Y|X}\left(y-\alpha-x^{\prime}\beta\right)^{2} & = & \mathcal{E}_{X}\mathcal{E}_{Y|X}\left(h(x,\theta^{0})+\varepsilon-\alpha-\beta x\right)^{2}\\
 & = & \sigma^{2}+\mathcal{E}_{X}\left(h(x,\theta^{0})-\alpha-\beta x\right)^{2}

 since cross products involving 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 drop out.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha^{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{0}$
\end_inset

 correspond to the hyperplane that is closest to the true regression function
 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x,\theta^{0})$
\end_inset

 according to the mean squared error criterion.
 This depends on both the shape of 
\begin_inset Formula $h(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 and the density function of the conditioning variables.

\begin_layout Standard
Let's use the results to get the asymptotic distribution of the OLS estimator
 applied to the classical model, to verify that we obtain the results seen

 The OLS criterion is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
s_{n}(\beta) & = & \frac{1}{n}\left(y-X\beta\right)^{\prime}\left(y-X\beta\right)\\

\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

The first derivative is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D_{\beta}s_{n}(\beta)=\frac{1}{n}\left[-2X^{\prime}X\left(\beta^{0}-\beta\right)-2X^{\prime}\epsilon\right]

\end_inset

so, evaluating at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{0},$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newpage newpage

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
thus, a LLN tells us this converges almost surely to 0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
to keep this from happening, we can multiply by something that is converging
 to infinity.
 It turns out that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}$
\end_inset

 is the right choice, because then the asymptotic distribution will be stable,
 and a CLT will apply.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, let's get the form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{I}_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 of Assumption (c): Considering 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}D_{\beta}s_{n}(\beta^{0})$
\end_inset

, it has expectation 0, so the variance is the expectation of the outer
 product (there's no need to subtract the mean):
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Var\sqrt{n}D_{\beta}s_{n}(\beta^{0}) & = & E\left[\left(-\sqrt{n}2\frac{X^{\prime}\epsilon}{n}\right)\left(-\sqrt{n}2\frac{X^{\prime}\epsilon}{n}\right)^{\prime}\right]\\
 & = & E4\frac{X^{\prime}\epsilon\epsilon^{\prime}X}{n}\\
 & = & 4\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}E\left(\frac{X^{\prime}X}{n}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

(because regressors are independent of errors).
 Therefore
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\beta^{0}) & = & \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}Var\sqrt{n}D_{\beta}s_{n}(\beta^{0})\\
 & = & 4\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}Q_{X}
\end{eqnarray*}

The second derivative is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{J}_{n}(\beta)=D_{\beta}^{2}s_{n}(\beta^{0})=\frac{1}{n}\left[2X^{\prime}X\right].
\]

\end_inset

A SLLN tells us that this converges almost surely to the limit of its expectatio
n:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{J}_{\infty}(\beta^{0})=2Q_{X}
\]

\end_inset

There's no parameter in that last expression, so uniformity is not an issue.

The asymptotic normality theorem (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) tells us that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\beta}-\beta^{0}\right) & \stackrel{d}{\rightarrow} & N\left[0,\mathcal{J}_{\infty}(\beta^{0})^{-1}\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\beta^{0})\mathcal{J}_{\infty}(\beta^{0})^{-1}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

which is, given the above,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\beta}-\beta^{0}\right)\stackrel{d}{\rightarrow}N\left[0,\left(\frac{Q_{X}^{-1}}{2}\right)\left(4\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}Q_{X}\right)\left(\frac{Q_{X}^{-1}}{2}\right)\right]
\]

\end_inset

or
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\beta}-\beta^{0}\right)\stackrel{d}{\rightarrow}N\left[0,Q_{X}^{-1}\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}\right].
\]

\end_inset

This is the same thing we saw in equation

 Suppose we estimate the misspecified model 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}=\alpha+\beta x_{i}+\eta_{i}$

 by OLS.
 Find the numeric values of

 that are the probability limits of

 Hint: the correct answers are 7/6 and -1.
 To get some help with this exercise, you can use a computer algebra program,
 as was done in Figure

 A small modification of that code would solve this problem.

Verify your results using Julia by generating data that follows the above
 model, and calculating the OLS estimator.
 When the sample size is very large the estimator should be very close to
 the analytical results you obtained in question

Use the asymptotic normality theorem to find the asymptotic distribution
 of the ML estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{0}$
\end_inset

 for the model 
\begin_inset Formula $y=x\beta^{0}+\varepsilon,$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon\sim N(0,1)$
\end_inset

 and is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $x.$
\end_inset

 This means finding 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\beta\partial\beta^{\prime}}s_{n}(\beta)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{J}(\beta^{0}),\left.\frac{\partial s_{n}(\beta)}{\partial\beta}\right|,$

\begin_layout Standard
This short chapter presents a simple DSGE model, which will be used to illustrat
e several estimators: ML, GMM, VARs, and Bayesian methods.
 DSGE models are quite widely used by central banks, etc., but they are not
 without their critics: see 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Paul Romer's WP \"The Trouble with Macroeconomics\""
target "https://paulromer.net/trouble-with-macroeconomics-update/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, for example.
 I like the DSGE model as an example because it allow illustrating a variety
 of econometric techniques and methods.
 Any other structural nonlinear model could serve the same purpose.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We will investigate structural estimation methods, which attempt to estimate
 the actual parameters of the data generating process, and reduced form
 methods, which characterize the data, but which do not recover the parameters
 of the data generating process.

Knowing the true DGP will allow us to measure sensibly how well the different
 methods work.

 This is done using Dynare (Juillard, 1996).
 A first step for solving the model using Dynare is to find the deterministic
 steady state.
 Let variables without the 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 subscript indicate the deterministic steady state level of the variable.
 The deterministic steady state values of the two shocks 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 are both 1.
 Using equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, dropping 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 subscripts, and setting the two shocks to 1, we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\psi}{c^{-\gamma}} & = & \left(1-\alpha\right)k^{\alpha}n^{-\alpha}\label{eq:MRS-MPL}\\
n & = & \left(\frac{1-\alpha}{\psi}\right)^{1/\alpha}kc^{-\gamma/\alpha}\nonumber

Define

so
\begin_inset Formula

\varphi:=\left[\frac{1}{\alpha}\left(\frac{1}{\beta}-1+\delta\right)\right]^{\frac{\text{1}}{1-\alpha}}\label{eq:phi}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

so
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
n=\varphi k\label{steadystate2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Now set equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:steadystate1"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "steadystate2"

\end_inset

 equal, and solve for steady state level of consumption:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\theta kc^{-\gamma/\alpha} & = & \varphi k\\
c^{-\gamma/\alpha} & = & \frac{\varphi}{\theta}\\
c & = & \left(\frac{\theta}{\varphi}\right)^{\frac{\alpha}{\gamma}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

From equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:capital"

\end_inset

, steady state investment satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
i=\delta k
\]

\end_inset

and combining this with equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:output"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:investment"

\end_inset

, we obtain (using equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "steadystate2"

\end_inset

)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c+\delta k=k^{\alpha}(\varphi k)^{1-\alpha}
\]

\end_inset

which solves as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k=\frac{c}{\varphi^{1-\alpha}-\delta}
\]

\begin_layout Standard
For this model, given the observable variables, we can recover 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=1-\frac{wn}{y}$
\end_inset

, by substituting the production function into the MPL or MPK.
 Once we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,$
\end_inset

 we can solve for 
\begin_inset Formula $k,$
\end_inset

 and with 
\begin_inset Formula $k,$
\end_inset

 we can recover 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 from the law of motion of capital.
 So, we will take 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 as known parameters, as they can be recovered exactly from the observable
 data.
 Henceforth, we set 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=0.33$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=0.025$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Estimation by GMM does not require specifying a prior distribution for the
 parameters, but Bayesian methods do, so here, I discuss the true parameter
 values used for the simulations, as well as priors.
 Economic intuition can guide choice of priors for most parameters.
 However, we may be less confident specifying a prior for the marginal rate
 of substitution, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi.$
\end_inset

 Instead, following Ruge-Murcia (2012), we may place a prior on steady state
 hours, 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 Given that hours 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 must satisfy the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le n_{t}\le1$
\end_inset

, and we know that normally around 8 hours per day is dedicated to work,
 it is relatively straightforward to place a prior on 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 If steady state hours, 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is given, say as a draw from it's prior, then this, along with the parameters,
 excepting 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, allows us to solve for the steady state values of the other variables
 and for 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, as follows: Given 
\begin_inset Formula $n,$
\end_inset

 we can compute 
\begin_inset Formula $k=n/\varphi,$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $i=\delta k,$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $y=k^{\alpha}n^{1-\alpha}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $c=y-i$
\end_inset

, and finally, using equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:MRS-MPL"

\end_inset

, we can compute the 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 that is consistent with the given steady state 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and the other parameters of the model as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\psi & = & c^{-\gamma}\left(1-\alpha\right)k^{\alpha}n^{-\alpha}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset

We use independent uniform priors for all parameters except 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi,$
\end_inset

 and a uniform prior for steady state hours, 
\begin_inset Formula $n.$
\end_inset

 The true values of the parameters and the supports of the uniform priors
 are given in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:True-parameters-and"

\end_inset

.
 We believe that most economists will find these priors to be quite loose,
 and the parameter values to be reasonable.

Solution of the model and generation of simulated data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a draw of the parameters other than 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is computed as above, and we can form the full parameter vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{s}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 indexes the simulations.
 The model is solved using Dynare, using a third order perturbation about
 the steady state.
 Once the model is solved, a simulation of length 260 is done, initialized
 at the steady state.
 We drop 100 observations, retaining the last 160 observations, which mimic
 40 years of quarterly data.
 The observable variables are 
\begin_inset Formula $y,\,c,\,n,\,w,$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 The capital stock 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is not observed.
 The selection of observable variables is in line with much empirical work
 (e.g.,

\begin_layout Standard
The maximum likelihood estimator is important because it uses all of the
 information in a fully specified statistical model.
 Its use of all of the information causes it to have a number of attractive
 properties, foremost of which is asymptotic efficiency.
 For this reason, the ML estimator can serve as a benchmark against which
 other estimators may be measured.
 The ML estimator requires that the statistical model be fully specified,
 which essentially means that there is enough information to draw data from
 the DGP, given the parameter.
 This is a fairly strong requirement, and for this reason we need to be
 concerned about the possible misspecification of the statistical model.
 If this is the case, the ML estimator will not have the nice properties
 that it has under correct specification.

Count data.
 Suppose we have a sample

\end_inset

 where the data are counts: the number of times some event occurs in a given
 interval of time, e.g., number of visits to the doctor in a year.
 The simplest count data density is the Poisson:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{Y}(y;\lambda)=\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{y}}{y!}

If the observations are i.i.d.

\begin_layout Itemize
Usually, for time series data, conditional densities depend only on current
 period exogenous variables, as the effects of lagged exogenous variables
 are transmitted though the realizations of the lagged endogenous variables,
 and economic models normally don't involve leads of exogenous variables.
 If this is the case,

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset

The criterion function can be defined as the average log-likelihood function:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{n}(\theta)=\frac{1}{n}\ln L(Y|Z;\theta)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\ln f(y_{t}|x_{t};\theta)

 The maximum likelihood estimator may thus be defined equivalently as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\theta}=\arg\max s_{n}(\theta),
\]

\end_inset

 where the set maximized over is defined below.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 is a monotonic increasing function, 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 maximize at the same value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta.$

\end_inset

Bernoulli trial
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Suppose that we are flipping a coin that may be biased, so that the probability
 of a heads may not be 0.5.
 Maybe we're interested in estimating the probability of a heads.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $Y=1(heads)$
\end_inset

 be a binary variable that indicates whether or not a heads is observed.
 The outcome of a toss is a Bernoulli random variable:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
f_{Y}(y,p_{0}) & = & p_{0}^{y}\left(1-p_{0}\right)^{1-y},y\in\{0,1\}\\
 & = & 0,y\notin\{0,1\}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

So a representative term that enters the likelihood function is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{Y}(y,p)=p^{y}\left(1-p\right)^{1-y}
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ln f_{Y}(y,p)=y\ln p+\left(1-y\right)\ln\left(1-p\right)
\]

\end_inset

For this example, the average log-likelihood function is 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}(p)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}y_{t}\ln p+\left(1-y_{t}\right)\ln\left(1-p\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset

The derivative of a representative term is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\partial\ln f_{Y}(y,p)}{\partial p} & = & \frac{y}{p}-\frac{\left(1-y\right)}{\left(1-p\right)}\\
 & = & \frac{y-p}{p\left(1-p\right)}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

so, averaging this over a sample of size 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, the gradient is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial s_{n}(p)}{\partial p}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{y_{t}-p}{p\left(1-p\right)}.
\]

\end_inset

Setting to zero and solving gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{p}=\bar{y}\label{eq:mle Bernoulli}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

So it's easy to calculate the MLE of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 in this case.
\begin_inset Newpage newpage

\begin_layout Itemize
We also know that the sample mean converges to the true mean, from basic
 statistics.

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_inset Formula $E(Y)=\sum_{y=0}^{y=1}yp_{0}^{y}\left(1-p_{0}\right)^{1-y}=p_{0}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Thus, the MLE, which is the sample mean, is a consistent estimator of the
 parameter, because the population mean is the parameter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For future reference, note that 
\begin_inset Formula $Var(Y)=E(Y^{2})-\left[E(Y)\right]^{2}=p_{0}-p_{0}^{2}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset

We see that the ML estimator is consistent, for this model.
 However, let's verify that the consistency theorem for extremum estimators
 gives us the same result:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A LLN tells us that, for a given 
\begin_inset Formula $p,$
\end_inset

 the objective function converges to the limit of its expectation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{n}(p)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}y_{t}\ln p+\left(1-y_{t}\right)\ln\left(1-p\right)\rightarrow^{a.s.}p_{0}\ln p+(1-p_{0})\ln(1-p).
\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The parameter space must be compact.
 We know that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 lies between 0 and 1, so this helps set the parameter space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the objective function is obviously continuous in the parameter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
we need the objective function to be bounded, for the simple sufficient
 conditions for the consistency theorem to hold.
 So, we need to assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 can't go to 0 or to 1.
 This means that the parameter space must be a compact subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(0,1\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
With these conditions, the a.s.
 convergence is also uniform.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The consistency theorem for extremum estimators tells us that the ML estimator
 converges to the value that maximizes the limiting objective function.
 Because 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{\infty}(p)=p_{0}\ln p+(1-p_{0})\ln(1-p)$
\end_inset

, we can easily check that the unique maximizer is 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So, the three assumptions of the consistency theorem hold, and thus the
 ML estimator is consistent for the true probability.

 Given some regularity conditions on boundedness of

 We can use

\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

as is intuitive if one considers equation

 Note, one can't use
\begin_inset Formula

From this we see that there are alternative ways to estimate

 that are all valid.
 These include 
\begin_inset Formula

 These are known as the

\begin_layout Itemize
Asymptotically, if the model is correctly specified, all of these forms
 converge to the same limit.
 In small samples they will differ.
 In particular, there is evidence that the outer product of the gradient
 formula does not perform very well in small samples (

\begin_layout Standard
In section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Example:-Bernoulli-trial"

\end_inset

 we saw that the MLE for the parameter of a Bernoulli trial, with i.i.d.
 data, is the sample mean: 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}=\bar{y}$
\end_inset

 (equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:mle Bernoulli"

\end_inset

).
 Now let's find the limiting variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{p}-p_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 We can do this in a simple way:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lim Var\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{p}-p_{0}\right) & = & \lim nVar\left(\hat{p}-p_{0}\right)\\
 & = & \lim nVar\left(\hat{p}\right)\\
 & = & \lim nVar\left(\bar{y}\right)\\
 & = & \lim nVar\left(\frac{\sum y_{t}}{n}\right)\\
 & = & \lim\frac{1}{n}\sum Var(y_{t})\textnormal{ (by independence of obs.)}\\
 & = & \lim\frac{1}{n}nVar(y)\textnormal{ (by identically distributed obs.)}\\
 & = & Var(y)\\
 & = & p_{0}\left(1-p_{0}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

While that is simple, let's verify this using the methods of Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "cha:Asymptotic-properties-of"

\end_inset

 give the same answer.
 The log-likelihood function is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
s_{n}(p) & = & \frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left\{ y_{t}\ln p+\left(1-y_{t}\right)\ln\left(1-p\right)\right\} 
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

so
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Es_{n}(p)=p^{0}\ln p+\left(1-p^{0}\right)\ln\left(1-p\right)
\]

\end_inset

by the fact that the observations are i.i.d.
 Note that this does not depend on the sample size, 
\begin_inset Formula $n,$
\end_inset

 thus, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{\infty}(p)=p^{0}\ln p+\left(1-p^{0}\right)\ln\left(1-p\right).
\]

\end_inset

 A bit of calculation shows that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left.D_{\theta}^{2}s_{\infty}(p)\right|_{p=p^{0}}\equiv\mathcal{J}_{\infty}(p^{0})=\frac{-1}{p^{0}\left(1-p^{0}\right)}.
\]

\end_inset

By results we've seen on MLE, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim Var\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{p}-p^{0}\right)=-\mathcal{J}_{\infty}^{-1}(p^{0}).$
\end_inset

 And in this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $-\mathcal{J}_{\infty}^{-1}(p^{0})=p^{0}\left(1-p^{0}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 So, we get the same limiting variance using both methods.

The limiting variance of a CAN estimator of

\end_inset

, say 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\theta}$
\end_inset

, minus the inverse of the information matrix is a positive semidefinite
 matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Proof: Since the estimator is CAN, it is asymptotically unbiased, so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\mathcal{E}_{\theta}(\tilde{\theta}-\theta)=0
\]

\end_inset

 Differentiate wrt 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{\prime}:$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
D_{\theta^{\prime}}\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\mathcal{E}_{\theta}(\tilde{\theta}-\theta) & = & \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int D_{\theta^{\prime}}\left[f(Y,\theta)\left(\tilde{\theta}-\theta\right)\right]dy\\
 & = & 0.\textrm{ }
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

(The RHS is zero, because we're differentiating something that is zero to
 start with).
 Noting that 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\theta^{\prime}}f(Y,\theta)=f(\theta)D_{\theta^{\prime}}\ln f(\theta)$
\end_inset

 (a trick we have seen a few times already), and applying the product rule
 to differentiate the two parts that depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta,$
\end_inset

 we can write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int\left(\tilde{\theta}-\theta\right)f(\theta)D_{\theta^{\prime}}\ln f(\theta)dy+\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int f(Y,\theta)D_{\theta^{\prime}}\left(\tilde{\theta}-\theta\right)dy=0.
\]

\end_inset

 Now note that 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\theta^{\prime}}\left(\tilde{\theta}-\theta\right)=-I_{K},$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\int f(Y,\theta)(-I_{K})dy=-I_{K}.$
\end_inset

 With this we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int\left(\tilde{\theta}-\theta\right)f(\theta)D_{\theta^{\prime}}\ln f(\theta)dy=I_{K}.
\]

\end_inset

 Playing with powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int\sqrt{n}\left(\tilde{\theta}-\theta\right)\sqrt{n}\underbrace{\frac{1}{n}\left[D_{\theta^{\prime}}\ln f(\theta)\right]}f(\theta)dy & = & I_{K}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 Note that the bracketed part is just the transpose of the score vector,
 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\theta),$
\end_inset

 so we can write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\mathcal{E}_{\theta}\left[\sqrt{n}\left(\tilde{\theta}-\theta\right)\sqrt{n}g(\theta)^{\prime}\right]=I_{K}
\]

\end_inset

 This means that the limiting covariance of the score function with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}\left(\tilde{\theta}-\theta\right),$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\theta}$
\end_inset

 any CAN
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

estimator, is an identity matrix.
 Using this, suppose the variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}\left(\tilde{\theta}-\theta\right)$
\end_inset

 tends to 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\infty}(\tilde{\theta}).$
\end_inset

 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V_{\infty}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\sqrt{n}\left(\tilde{\theta}-\theta\right)\\
\sqrt{n}g(\theta)
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
V_{\infty}(\tilde{\theta}) & I_{K}\\
I_{K} & \mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta)
\end{array}\right].\label{Cov. CAN and MLE score}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Since this is a covariance matrix, it is positive semi-definite.
 Therefore, for any 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 -vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\alpha^{\prime} & -\alpha^{\prime}\mathcal{I}_{\infty}^{-1}(\theta)\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
V_{\infty}(\tilde{\theta}) & I_{K}\\
I_{K} & \mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta)
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\alpha\\
-\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta)^{-1}\alpha
\end{array}\right]\geq0.
\]

\end_inset

 This simplifies to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha^{\prime}\left[V_{\infty}(\tilde{\theta})-\mathcal{I}_{\infty}^{-1}(\theta)\right]\alpha\geq0.
\]

\end_inset

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is arbitrary, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\infty}(\tilde{\theta})-\mathcal{I}_{\infty}^{-1}(\theta)$
\end_inset

 must be positive semidefinite.
 This concludes the proof.

Suppose we would like to test a set of

.
 The Wald test can be calculated using the unrestricted model.
 The score test can be calculated using only the restricted model.
 The likelihood ratio test, on the other hand, uses both the restricted
 and the unrestricted estimators.
 The test statistic is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
LR=2\left(\ln L(\hat{\theta})-\ln L(\tilde{\theta})\right)=2n\left[s_{n}(\hat{\theta})-s_{n}(\tilde{\theta})\right]
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}$
\end_inset

 is the unrestricted estimate and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\theta}$
\end_inset

 is the restricted estimate.
 We will show that, under the null hypothesis that 
\begin_inset Formula $r(\theta)=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
LR\overset{d}{\rightarrow}\chi^{2}(q).
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset

To show that it is asymptotically 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2},$
\end_inset

 take a second order Taylor's series expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln L(\tilde{\theta})$
\end_inset

 about 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}:$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ln L(\tilde{\theta})\simeq\ln L(\hat{\theta})+\frac{n}{2}\left(\tilde{\theta}-\hat{\theta}\right)^{\prime}\mathcal{J}(\hat{\theta})\left(\tilde{\theta}-\hat{\theta}\right)
\]

\end_inset

 (note, the first order term drops out since 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\theta}\ln L(\hat{\theta})\equiv0$
\end_inset

 by the first order necessary conditions, and we need to multiply the second-ord
er term by 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{J}(\theta)$
\end_inset

 is defined in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{n}\ln L(\theta)$
\end_inset

) so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
LR\simeq-n\left(\tilde{\theta}-\hat{\theta}\right)^{\prime}\mathcal{J}(\hat{\theta})\left(\tilde{\theta}-\hat{\theta}\right)
\]

\end_inset

 As 
\begin_inset Formula $n\rightarrow\infty,\mathcal{J}(\hat{\theta})\rightarrow\mathcal{J}_{\infty}(\theta_{0})=-\mathcal{I}(\theta_{0}),$
\end_inset

 by the information matrix equality.
 So 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
LR\overset{a}{=}n\left(\tilde{\theta}-\hat{\theta}\right)^{\prime}\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta_{0})\left(\tilde{\theta}-\hat{\theta}\right)\label{eq:LR2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 We also have that, from the theory on the asymptotic normality of the MLE
 and the information matrix equality 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\theta}-\theta_{0}\right)\overset{a}{=}\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta_{0})^{-1}n^{1/2}g(\theta_{0}).
\]

\end_inset

An analogous result for the restricted estimator is (this is unproven here,
 to prove this set up the Lagrangean for MLE subject to 
\begin_inset Formula $r(\theta)=0,$
\end_inset

 and manipulate the first order conditions.
 Also note, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is notation for 
\begin_inset Formula $R=D_{\theta}r^{\prime}(\theta)$
\end_inset

): 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}\left(\tilde{\theta}-\theta_{0}\right)\overset{a}{=}\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta_{0})^{-1}\left(I_{n}-R^{\prime}\left(R\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta_{0})^{-1}R^{\prime}\right)^{-1}R\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta_{0})^{-1}\right)n^{1/2}g(\theta_{0}).
\]

\end_inset

 Combining the last two equations 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}\left(\tilde{\theta}-\hat{\theta}\right)\overset{a}{=}-n^{1/2}\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta_{0})^{-1}R^{\prime}\left(R\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta_{0})^{-1}R^{\prime}\right)^{-1}R\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta_{0})^{-1}g(\theta_{0})
\]

\end_inset

 so, substituting into [
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:LR2"

\end_inset

] 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
LR\overset{a}{=}\left[n^{1/2}g(\theta_{0})^{\prime}\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta_{0})^{-1}R^{\prime}\right]\left[R\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta_{0})^{-1}R^{\prime}\right]^{-1}\left[R\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta_{0})^{-1}n^{1/2}g(\theta_{0})\right]
\]

\end_inset

 But since 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n^{1/2}g(\theta_{0})\overset{d}{\rightarrow}N\left(0,\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta_{0})\right)
\]

\end_inset

 the linear function 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta_{0})^{-1}n^{1/2}g(\theta_{0})\overset{d}{\rightarrow}N(0,R\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta_{0})^{-1}R^{\prime}).
\]

\end_inset

 We can see that LR is a quadratic form of this rv, with the inverse of
 its variance in the middle, so, by the Continuous Mapping Theorem (also
 known as the Mann-Wald Theorem) (see

\begin_layout Subsection
Example: Binary response models: theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section extends the Bernoulli trial model to binary response models
 with conditioning variables, as such models arise in a variety of contexts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y^{*} & = & x^{\prime}\theta-\varepsilon\\
y & = & 1(y^{*}>0)\\
\varepsilon & \sim & N(0,1)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{*}$
\end_inset

 is an unobserved (latent) continuous variable, and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 is a binary variable that indicates whether 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{*}$
\end_inset

is negative or positive.
 Then the 
\emph on
probit 
\emph default
model results, where 
\begin_inset Formula $Pr(y=1|x)=Pr(\varepsilon<x^{\prime}\theta)=\Phi(x^{\prime}\theta)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Phi(\cdot)=\int_{-\infty}^{x\beta}(2\pi)^{-1/2}\exp(-\frac{\varepsilon^{2}}{2})d\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset

is the standard normal distribution function.
\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
logit 
\emph default
model results if the errors 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 are not normal, but rather have a logistic distribution.
 This distribution is similar to the standard normal, but has fatter tails.
 The probability, in this case, has the following parameterization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Pr(y=1|x)=\Lambda(x^{\prime}\theta)=\left(1+\exp(-x^{\prime}\theta)\right)^{-1}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, a binary response model will require that the choice probability
 be parameterized in some form which could be logit, probit, or something
 else.
 For a vector of explanatory variables 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, the response probability will be parameterized in some manner
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Pr(y=1|x)=p(x,\theta)
\]

\end_inset

Again, if 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x,\theta)=\Lambda(x^{\prime}\theta),$
\end_inset

 we have a logit model.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x,\theta)=\Phi(x^{\prime}\theta),$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 is the standard normal distribution function, then we have a probit model.
\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The following is another verification of the information matrix equality,
 skip this in lectures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of the parameterization, we are dealing with a Bernoulli density,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{Y_{i}}(y_{i}|x_{i})=p(x_{i},\theta)^{y_{i}}(1-p(x,\theta))^{1-y_{i}}
\]

\end_inset

 so as long as the observations are independent, the maximum likelihood
 (ML) estimator, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta},$
\end_inset

 is the maximizer of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
s_{n}(\theta) & = & \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(y_{i}\ln p(x_{i},\theta)+(1-y_{i})\ln\left[1-p(x_{i},\theta)\right]\right)\nonumber \\
 & \equiv & \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}s(y_{i},x_{i},\theta).\label{s(y,A...)}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

 Following the above theoretical results, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}$
\end_inset

 tends in probability to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

 that maximizes the uniform almost sure limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}(\theta).$
\end_inset

 Noting that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}y_{i}=p(x_{i},\theta_{0}),$
\end_inset

 and following a SLLN for i.i.d.
 processes, 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}(\theta)$
\end_inset

 converges almost surely to the expectation of a representative term 
\begin_inset Formula $s(y,x,\theta).$
\end_inset

 First one can take the expectation conditional on 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 to get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{E}_{y|x}\left\{ y\ln p(x,\theta)+(1-y)\ln\left[1-p(x,\theta)\right]\right\} =p(x,\theta_{0})\ln p(x,\theta)+\left[1-p(x,\theta_{0})\right]\ln\left[1-p(x,\theta)\right].
\]

\end_inset

 Next taking expectation over 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 we get the limiting objective function 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
s_{\infty}(\theta)=\int_{\mathcal{X}}\left\{ p(x,\theta_{0})\ln p(x,\theta)+\left[1-p(x,\theta_{0})\right]\ln\left[1-p(x,\theta)\right]\right\} \mu(x)dx,\label{QMLlimitingobjfun}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(x)$
\end_inset

 is the (joint - the integral is understood to be multiple, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{X}$
\end_inset

 is the support of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

) density function of the explanatory variables 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 This is clearly continuous in 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta,$
\end_inset

 as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x,\theta)$
\end_inset

 is continuous, and if the parameter space is compact we therefore have
 uniform almost sure convergence.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x,\theta)$
\end_inset

 is continuous for the logit and probit models, for example.
 The maximizing element of 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{\infty}(\theta),$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{*},$
\end_inset

 solves the first order conditions 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int_{\mathcal{X}}\left\{ \frac{p(x,\theta_{0})}{p(x,\theta^{*})}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}p(x,\theta^{*})-\frac{1-p(x,\theta_{0})}{1-p(x,\theta^{*})}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}p(x,\theta^{*})\right\} \mu(x)dx=0
\]

\end_inset

 This is clearly solved by 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{*}=\theta_{0}.$
\end_inset

 Provided the solution is unique, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}$
\end_inset

 is consistent.
 Question:
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

what's needed to ensure that the solution is unique?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The asymptotic normality theorem tells us that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\theta}-\theta^{0}\right)\stackrel{d}{\rightarrow}N\left[0,\mathcal{J}_{\infty}(\theta^{0})^{-1}\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta^{0})\mathcal{J}_{\infty}(\theta^{0})^{-1}\right].
\]

\end_inset

 In the case of i.i.d.
 observations 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta_{0})=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}Var\sqrt{n}D_{\theta}s_{n}(\theta_{0})$
\end_inset

 is simply the expectation of a typical element of the outer product of
 the gradient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There's no need to subtract the mean, since it's zero, following the f.o.c.
 in the consistency proof above and the fact that observations are i.i.d.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The terms in 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 also drop out by the same argument: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}Var\sqrt{n}D_{\theta}s_{n}(\theta_{0}) & = & \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}Var\sqrt{n}D_{\theta}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t}s(\theta_{0})\\
 & = & \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}Var\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}D_{\theta}\sum_{t}s(\theta_{0})\\
 & = & \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{n}Var\sum_{t}D_{\theta}s(\theta_{0})\\
 & = & \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}VarD_{\theta}s(\theta_{0})\\
 & = & VarD_{\theta}s(\theta_{0})
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta_{0})=\mathcal{E}\left\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}s(y,x,\theta_{0})\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta^{\prime}}s(y,x,\theta_{0})\right\} .
\]

\end_inset

 Likewise, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{J}_{\infty}(\theta_{0})=\mathcal{E}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\theta\partial\theta^{\prime}}s(y,x,\theta_{0}).
\]

\end_inset

 Expectations are jointly over 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x,$
\end_inset

 or equivalently, first over 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 conditional on 
\begin_inset Formula $x,$
\end_inset

 then over 
\begin_inset Formula $x.$
\end_inset

 From above, a typical element of the objective function is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s(y,x,\theta_{0})=y\ln p(x,\theta_{0})+(1-y)\ln\left[1-p(x,\theta_{0})\right].
\]

\end_inset

 Now suppose that we are dealing with a correctly specified logit model:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p(x,\theta)=\left(1+\exp(-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\theta)\right)^{-1}.
\]

\end_inset

 We can simplify the above results in this case.
 We have that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}p(x,\theta) & = & \left(1+\exp(-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\theta)\right)^{-2}\exp(-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\theta)\mathbf{x}\\
 & = & \left(1+\exp(-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\theta)\right)^{-1}\frac{\exp(-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\theta)}{1+\exp(-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\theta)}\mathbf{x}\\
 & = & p(x,\theta)\left(1-p(x,\theta)\right)\mathbf{x}\\
 & = & \left(p(x,\theta)-p(x,\theta)^{2}\right)\mathbf{x}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 So 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}s(y,x,\theta_{0}) & = & \left[y-p(x,\theta_{0})\right]\mathbf{x}\label{QMLgradient}\\
\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\theta\partial\theta^{\prime}}s(\theta_{0}) & = & -\left[p(x,\theta_{0})-p(x,\theta_{0})^{2}\right]\mathbf{xx}^{\prime}.\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

 Taking expectations over 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta_{0}) & = & \int E_{Y}\left[y^{2}-2p(x,\theta_{0})p(x,\theta_{0})+p(x,\theta_{0})^{2}\right]\mathbf{xx}^{\prime}\mu(x)dx\label{I}\\
 & = & \int\left[p(x,\theta_{0})-p(x,\theta_{0})^{2}\right]\mathbf{xx}^{\prime}\mu(x)dx.
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

 where we use the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{Y}(y)=E_{Y}(y^{2})=p(\mathbf{x},\theta_{0})$
\end_inset

.
 Likewise, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{J}_{\infty}(\theta_{0})=-\int\left[p(x,\theta_{0})-p(x,\theta_{0})^{2}\right]\mathbf{xx}^{\prime}\mu(x)dx.\label{J}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
On a final note, the logit and standard normal CDF's are very similar -
 the logit distribution is a bit more fat-tailed.

\begin_layout Standard
Testing reduction of a NB model to a Poisson model cannot be done by testing
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=0$
\end_inset

 using standard Wald or LR procedures.
 The critical values need to be adjusted to account for the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=0$
\end_inset

 is on the boundary of the parameter space.
 Without getting into details, suppose that the data were in fact Poisson,
 so there is equidispersion and the true 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=0$
\end_inset

.
 Then about half the time the sample data will be underdispersed, and about
 half the time overdispersed.
 When the data is underdispersed, the MLE of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 will be 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\alpha}=0$

 Thus, under the null, there will be a probability spike in the asymptotic
 distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n(}\hat{\alpha}-\alpha)=\sqrt{n}\hat{\alpha}$

 at 0, so standard testing methods will not be valid.

For OBDV, the overdispersion problem is significantly better than in the
 Poisson case, but there is still some that is not captured.
 For ERV, the negative binomial model seems to capture the overdispersion
 adequately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Finite mixture models: the mixed negative binomial model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The finite mixture approach to fitting health care demand was introduced
 by Deb and Trivedi (1997).
 The mixture approach has the intuitive appeal of allowing for subgroups
 of the population with different health status.
 If individuals are classified as healthy or unhealthy then two subgroups
 are defined.
 A finer classification scheme would lead to more subgroups.
 Many studies have incorporated objective and/or subjective indicators of
 health status in an effort to capture this heterogeneity.
 The available objective measures, such as limitations on activity, are
 not necessarily very informative about a person's overall health status.
 Subjective, self-reported measures may suffer from the same problem, and
 may also not be exogenous
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finite mixture models are conceptually simple.
 The density is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{Y}(y,\phi_{1},...,\phi_{p},\pi_{1},...,\pi_{p-1})=\sum_{i=1}^{p-1}\pi_{i}f_{Y}^{(i)}(y,\phi_{i})+\pi_{p}f_{Y}^{p}(y,\phi_{p}),
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{i}>0,i=1,2,...,p$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{p}=1-\sum_{i=1}^{p-1}\pi_{i}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{p}\pi_{i}=1$
\end_inset

.
 Identification requires that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{i}$
\end_inset

 are ordered in some way, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{1}\geq\pi_{2}\geq\cdots\geq\pi_{p}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i}\neq\phi_{j},i\neq j$
\end_inset

.
 This is simple to accomplish post-estimation by rearrangement and possible
 elimination of redundant component densities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The properties of the mixture density follow in a straightforward way from
 those of the components.
 In particular, the moment generating function is the same mixture of the
 moment generating functions of the component densities, so, for example,
 
\begin_inset Formula $E(Y|x)=\sum_{i=1}^{p}\pi_{i}\mu_{i}(x)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}(x)$
\end_inset

 is the mean of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 component density.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mixture densities may suffer from overparameterization, since the total
 number of parameters grows rapidly with the number of component densities.
 It is possible to constrained parameters across the mixtures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Testing for the number of component densities is a tricky issue.
 For example, testing for 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1$
\end_inset

 (a single component, which is to say, no mixture) versus 
\begin_inset Formula $p=2$
\end_inset

 (a mixture of two components) involves the restriction 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{1}=1$
\end_inset

, which is on the boundary of the parameter space.
 Not that when 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{1}=1$
\end_inset

, the parameters of the second component can take on any value without affecting
 the density.
 Usual methods such as the likelihood ratio test are not applicable when
 parameters are on the boundary under the null hypothesis.
 Information criteria means of choosing the model (see below) are valid.

It is worth noting that the mixture parameter is not significantly different

 age, for example, differ quite a bit between the two latent classes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Information criteria
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As seen above, a Poisson model can't be tested (using standard methods)
 as a restriction of a negative binomial model.
 But it seems, based upon the values of the likelihood functions and the
 fact that the NB model fits the variance much better, that the NB model
 is more appropriate.
 How can we determine which of a set of competing models is the best?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information criteria approach is one possibility.
 Information criteria are functions of the log-likelihood, with a penalty
 for the number of parameters used.
 Three popular information criteria are the Akaike (AIC), Bayes (BIC) and
 consistent Akaike (CAIC).
 The formulae are
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
CAIC & = & -2\ln L(\hat{\theta})+k(\ln n+1)\\
BIC & = & -2\ln L(\hat{\theta})+k\ln n\\
AIC & = & -2\ln L(\hat{\theta})+2k
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

It can be shown that the CAIC and BIC will select the correctly specified
 model from a group of models, asymptotically.
 This doesn't mean, of course, that the correct model is necessarily in
 the group.
 The AIC is not consistent, and will asymptotically favor an over-parameterized
 model over the correctly specified model.
 Here are information criteria values for the models we've seen, for OBDV.

Pretty clearly, the NB models are better than the Poisson.
 The one additional parameter gives a very significant improvement in the
 likelihood function value.
 Between the NB-I and NB-II models, the NB-II is very slightly favored.
 But one should remember that information criteria values are statistics,
 with variances.
 With another sample, it may well be that the NB-I model would be favored,
 since the differences are so small.
 The MNB-II model is favored over the others, by all 3 information criteria.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Estimation works when the parameters start values are close enough to their
 true values, but it doesn't work when less informative start values are
 tried: probably the objective function is nonconcave, so care must be taken
 to try enough start values.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When order=1, the estimation process involves forming a linear approximation
 to the true model, which means that the estimator is not actually the true
 maximum likelihood estimator, it is actually a 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

quasi-ML
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

 estimator (refer to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Example:-Linearization-of"

\end_inset

).
 The quasi-likelihood is computed by putting the linearized model in state-space
 form, and then computing the likelihood iteratively using Kalman filtering,
 which relies on the assumption that shocks to the model are normally distribute
d.
 State space models and Kalman filtering are introduced in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:State-space-models"

\end_inset

.
 Once the likelihood function is available, the methods studied in this
 Chapter may be applied.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The linearization of the model, combined with the fact that it has only
 two shocks, leads to a problem of 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

stochastic singularity
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

, which means that at most two observed variables may be used to compute
 the likelihood function.
 The code lets you explore the choice.
 It seems to work best using c and n.
 For some choices, the true parameter values will be outside the confidence
 intervals.
 If interested, do a Google search for this term, along with DSGE, and you'll
 find more information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Not using all of the observed variables for estimation is very likely to
 cause problems of lack of identification and inefficiency.
 This can be confirmed if you experiment with the estimation script.
 Using c and n, we get the above results.
 Using other variables, we get results that aren't so good.
 When you don't know the true parameters, how will you choose which results
 to believe?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This is not a problem of the ML method, it is a problem due to the fact
 that we are not really estimating the true model, we're working with a
 linear approximation.
 Often, people artificially add measurement error to the variables, which
 gets around the stochastic singularity problem, possibly at the cost of
 introducing a worse problem.
 I have not yet seen a careful study of the effect of estimating assuming
 measurement error when there really is no measurement error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The intention of presenting this example is to show that ML may be used
 for estimation of complex models.
 The problem here is that the econometric model is not complex enough: the
 linearization throws away so much information so that estimation becomes
 impossible.
 A better solution is to try to actually do ML estimation for the true nonlinear
 model: see papers by Fernández-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramírez, which use
 particle filtering.
 You can also modify the script to do this, by setting order=2 in the code,
 as Dynare supports the particle filter option.
 This is very time-consuming, though.

Moment contribution: we will be dealing with moment conditions that are

\emph default
 The

th moment contribution 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{t}$

 I'm casually using 
\begin_inset Formula $m(Z_{t},\theta),$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{t}(\theta)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{t}$
\end_inset

 to all refer to the same thing.
 This first of these is the full expression, but I will suppress arguments
 when the context makes things clear enough, to reduce the notational burden.
 The main thing is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{m}_{n}$
\end_inset

 refers to the average over the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 observations, and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{t}$
\end_inset

 refers to the terms that are averaged.
 
\begin_inset Newpage newpage

\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
OLS.
 The classical linear model.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{m}_{n}(\beta)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t}x_{t}(y_{t}-x_{t}^{\prime}\beta).$
\end_inset

 So the moment contributions are 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{t}(\beta)=x_{t}(y_{t}-x_{t}^{\prime}\beta)$
\end_inset

.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\beta_{0},$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}-x_{t}^{\prime}\beta_{0}=\epsilon_{t},$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{t}=x_{t}\epsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 We know that 
\begin_inset Formula $E(x_{t}\epsilon_{t})=0,$
\end_inset

 by the weak exogeneity assumption.
 Thus, the moment contributions, and the moment condition, which is their
 average, have expectation zero when evaluated at the true parameter value.

\begin_inset Formula $E\left(D_{\theta}\ln f(y_{t}|x_{x},\theta_{0})\right)=0$

 So, we could set

\end_inset

 Suppose we draw a random sample of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 from the 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}(\theta_{0})$
\end_inset

 distribution.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the parameter of interest.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $Y\sim\chi^{2}(\theta_{0})$
\end_inset

, then the mean 
\begin_inset Formula $E(Y)=\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Let the moment contribution be 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m_{t}(\theta)=y_{t}-\theta
\]

\end_inset

Then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\bar{m}_{n}(\theta) & =\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}m_{t}(\theta)=\bar{y}-\theta
\end{align*}

\end_inset

We know that the 
\begin_inset Formula $E(\bar{y})=\theta_{0}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $E\bar{m}_{n}(\theta_{0})=0.$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
However, 
\begin_inset Formula $E\bar{m}_{n}(\theta)=\theta_{0}-\theta\ne$
\end_inset

0 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\ne\theta_{0}.$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the dimension of the moment conditions is the same as the dimension
 of the parameter vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, the 
\emph on
method of moments principle
\emph default
 is to choose the estimator of the parameter to 
\emph on
set the moment condition equal to zero
\emph default
: 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{m}_{n}(\hat{\theta})\equiv0$
\end_inset

.
 Then the equation is solved for the estimator.
 In the case of OLS, this gives 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{t}x_{t}(y_{t}-x_{t}^{\prime}\hat{\beta})=0,$
\end_inset

 which gives a solution that you should already know.
 For the chi-squared example, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\bar{m}(\hat{\theta})=\bar{y}-\hat{\theta}=0
\]

\end_inset

is solved by 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}=\bar{y}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{y}=\sum_{t=1}^{n}y_{t}/n\stackrel{p}{\rightarrow}\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

 by the LLN, the estimator is consistent.
\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2},$
\end_inset

 version 2.
 The variance of a 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}(\theta_{0})$
\end_inset

 r.v.
 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V\left(Y\right)=E\left(Y-\theta_{0}\right)^{2}=2\theta_{0}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Let 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
m_{t}(\theta) & =\frac{n}{n-1}\left(y_{t}-\bar{y}\right)^{2}-2\theta
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\bar{m}_{n}(\theta)=\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left(y_{t}-\bar{y}\right)^{2}}{n-1}-2\theta.
\]

\end_inset

The first term is the unbiased formula for the sample variance, and thus
 has expectation equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $2\theta_{0}.$
\end_inset

 So if we evaluate 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{m}_{n}(\theta)$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0},$
\end_inset

 the expectation is zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
The MM estimator using the variance would set 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\bar{m}_{n}(\hat{\theta})=\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left(y_{t}-\bar{y}\right)^{2}}{n-1}-2\hat{\theta}\equiv0.
\]

\end_inset

Solving for the estimator, it is half the sample variance: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\theta}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left(y_{t}-\bar{y}\right)^{2}}{n-\text{1}}.
\]

\end_inset

Again, by the LLN, the sample variance is consistent for the true variance,
 that is, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left(y_{t}-\bar{y}\right)^{2}}{n}\stackrel{p}{\rightarrow}2\theta_{0}.
\]

\end_inset

So, this MM is also consistent for

 which means that we have more information than is strictly necessary for
 consistent estimation of the parameter.

\begin_layout Itemize

 in estimation, it just as easily could have been normally distributed,
 sampling from a 
\begin_inset Formula $N(\theta_{0},2\theta_{0})$

 distribution.
 As long as the assumptions regarding the mean or variance are correct,
 the MM estimators are consistent.
 So, we don't make use of distributional assumptions when doing method of
 moment estimation, we only rely on certain moments being correctly specified.
 In this way, method of moments estimation is

 There being no free lunch, we should expect to pay something for this,

To summarize

, a moment condition is a vector valued function which has expectation zero
 at the true parameter value.
 We have seen some examples of where we might get such functions, and more
 will follow.

 of the estimator.

What's the reason for using GMM if MLE is asymptotically efficient?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Robustness: GMM is based upon a limited set of moment conditions.
 For consistency, only these moment conditions need to be correctly specified,
 whereas MLE in effect requires correct specification of

every conceivable

 moment condition.
 GMM is 
\emph on
robust with respect to distributional misspecification.

\emph default
 The price for robustness is usually a loss of efficiency with respect to
 the MLE estimator.
 Keep in mind that the true distribution is 
\bar under
not known
\bar default
 so if we erroneously specify a distribution and estimate by MLE, the estimator
 will be inconsistent in general (not always).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Feasibility: in some cases the MLE estimator is not available, because we
 are not able to deduce or compute the likelihood function.

Consistency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We simply assume that the assumptions of Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Consistency of ee"

\end_inset

 hold, so the GMM estimator is strongly consistent.
 The main requirement is that the moment conditions have mean zero at the
 true parameter value, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{0}.$
\end_inset

 This will be the case if our moment conditions are correctly specified.
 With this, it is clear that the minimum of the limiting objective function
 occurs at the true parameter value.
 The only assumption that warrants additional comment is that of identification.
 In Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Consistency of ee"

\end_inset

, the third assumption reads: (c) 
\shape italic
Identification:
\shape default
 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{\infty}(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 has a unique global maximum at 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{0},$

i.e.,
\shape default
 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{\infty}(\theta^{0})>s_{\infty}(\theta),$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall\theta\neq\theta^{0}.$
\end_inset

 Taking the case of a quadratic objective function 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}(\theta)=\bar{m}_{n}(\theta)^{\prime}W_{n}\bar{m}_{n}(\theta),$
\end_inset

 first consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{m}_{n}(\theta).$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Applying a uniform law of large numbers, we get 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{m}_{n}(\theta)\stackrel{a.s.}{\rightarrow}m_{\infty}(\theta).$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $E\bar{m}_{n}(\theta^{0})=0$
\end_inset

 by assumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{\infty}(\theta^{0})=0.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{\infty}(\theta^{0})=m_{\infty}(\theta^{0})^{\prime}W_{\infty}m_{\infty}(\theta^{0})=0,$

\begin_inset Formula $m_{\infty}(\theta)\neq0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\neq\theta^{0},$
\end_inset

 for at least some element of the vector.
 There can be no other parameter value that sets the moment conditions to
 zero (at least, in the limit).

 However, we do need to find the structure of the asymptotic variance-covariance

 From Theorem

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\theta}-\theta^{0}\right)\stackrel{d}{\rightarrow}N\left[0,\mathcal{J}_{\infty}(\theta^{0})^{-1}\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta^{0})\mathcal{J}_{\infty}(\theta^{0})^{-1}\right]

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\theta\partial\theta^{\prime}}s_{n}(\theta)$
\end_inset

 when evaluated at 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{0}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta^{0})=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}Var\sqrt{n}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}s_{n}(\theta^{0}).

 We need to determine the form of these matrices given the objective function

 Now, given that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{m}(\theta^{0})$
\end_inset

 is an average of centered (mean-zero) quantities, it is reasonable to expect

 the asymptotic variance of

Proof:
\series default
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{\infty}=\Omega_{\infty}^{-1},$
\end_inset

 the asymptotic variance 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(D_{\infty}W_{\infty}D_{\infty}^{\prime}\right)^{-1}D_{\infty}W_{\infty}\Omega_{\infty}W_{\infty}D_{\infty}^{\prime}\left(D_{\infty}W_{\infty}D_{\infty}^{\prime}\right)^{-1}
\]

\end_inset

 simplifies to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(D_{\infty}\Omega_{\infty}^{-1}D_{\infty}^{\prime}\right)^{-1}.$
\end_inset

 Now, let 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 be the difference between the general form and the simplified form: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
A=\left(D_{\infty}W_{\infty}D_{\infty}^{\prime}\right)^{-1}D_{\infty}W_{\infty}\Omega_{\infty}W_{\infty}D_{\infty}^{\prime}\left(D_{\infty}W_{\infty}D_{\infty}^{\prime}\right)^{-1} & - & \left(D_{\infty}\Omega_{\infty}^{-1}D_{\infty}^{\prime}\right)^{-1}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Set 
\begin_inset Formula $B=\left(D_{\infty}W_{\infty}D_{\infty}^{\prime}\right)^{-1}D_{\infty}W_{\infty}-\left(D_{\infty}\Omega_{\infty}^{-1}D_{\infty}^{\prime}\right)^{-1}D_{\infty}\Omega_{\infty}^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 One can show that 
\begin_inset Formula $A=B\Omega_{\infty}B^{'}$
\end_inset

.
 This is a quadratic form in a p.d.
 matrix, so it is p.s.d., which concludes the proof.

The result

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\theta}-\theta^{0}\right)\stackrel{d}{\rightarrow}N\left[0,\left(D_{\infty}\Omega_{\infty}^{-1}D_{\infty}^{\prime}\right)^{-1}\right]\label{gmm distribution with optimal weighting matrix}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 allows us to treat 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\theta}\approx N\left(\theta^{0},\frac{\left(D_{\infty}\Omega_{\infty}^{-1}D_{\infty}^{\prime}\right)^{-1}}{n}\right),
\]

\end_inset

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx$
\end_inset

 means 
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 To operationalize this we need estimators of 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{\infty}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The obvious estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{D_{\infty}}$
\end_inset

 is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\bar{m}_{n}\left(\hat{\theta}\right),$
\end_inset

 which is consistent by the consistency of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta},$
\end_inset

 assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\bar{m}_{n}$
\end_inset

 is continuous in 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta.$
\end_inset

 Stochastic equicontinuity results can give us this result even if 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\bar{m}_{n}$
\end_inset

 is not continuous.

\end_inset

 In general, we expect that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $m_{t}$

 will be autocorrelated (
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{ts}=\mathcal{E}(m_{t}m_{t-s}^{\prime})\neq0$

 Note that this autocovariance will not depend on

\end_inset

 if the moment conditions are covariance stationary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
contemporaneously correlated, since the individual moment contributions
 will not in general be independent of one another (

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
and have different variances (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}(m_{it}^{2})=\sigma_{it}^{2}$
\end_inset

 ).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we need to estimate so many components, it is unlikely that we would
 arrive at a correct parametric specification.
 For this reason, research has focused on consistent nonparametric estimators
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{\infty}.$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Henceforth we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{t}$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
covariance stationary
\emph default
, so the covariance between 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{t-s}$

 does not depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $t.$
\end_inset

 (See the first part of Chapter

\end_inset

 autocovariance of covariance stationary moment contributions as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{s}=\mathcal{E}(m_{t}m_{t-s}^{\prime}).$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of stationarity, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{s}$
\end_inset

 does not depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $t.$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}(m_{t}m_{t+s}^{\prime})=\Gamma_{s}^{\prime}.$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{m}_{n}$
\end_inset

 are functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta,$
\end_inset

 so for now assume that we have some consistent estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{0}$
\end_inset

.
 With this, a consistent estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{t}(\theta^{0})$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{m}_{t}=m_{t}(\hat{\theta}).$
\end_inset

 Now 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Omega_{n} & = & \mathcal{E}\left[n\bar{m}_{n}(\theta^{0})\bar{m}_{n}(\theta^{0})^{\prime}\right]=\mathcal{E}\left[n\left(1/n\sum_{t=1}^{n}m_{t}\right)\left(1/n\sum_{t=1}^{n}m_{t}^{\prime}\right)\right]\\
 & = & \mathcal{E}\left[1/n\left(\sum_{t=1}^{n}m_{t}\right)\left(\sum_{t=1}^{n}m_{t}^{\prime}\right)\right]\\
 & = & \Gamma_{0}+\frac{n-1}{n}\left(\Gamma_{1}+\Gamma_{1}^{\prime}\right)+\frac{n-2}{n}\left(\Gamma_{2}+\Gamma_{2}^{\prime}\right)\cdots+\frac{1}{n}\left(\Gamma_{n-1}+\Gamma_{n-1}^{\prime}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 A natural, consistent estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{s}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{\Gamma_{s}}=1/n\sum_{t=s+1}^{n}\hat{m}_{t}\hat{m}_{t-s}^{\prime}.
\]

\end_inset

 (you might use 
\begin_inset Formula $n-s$
\end_inset

 in the denominator instead).
\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset

 So, a natural, but inconsistent, estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 would be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\Omega} & = & \widehat{\Gamma_{0}}+\frac{n-1}{n}\left(\widehat{\Gamma_{1}}+\widehat{\Gamma_{1}^{\prime}}\right)+\frac{n-2}{n}\left(\widehat{\Gamma_{2}}+\widehat{\Gamma_{2}^{\prime}}\right)+\cdots+\left(\widehat{\Gamma_{n-1}}+\widehat{\Gamma_{n-1}^{\prime}}\right)\\
 & = & \widehat{\Gamma_{0}}+\sum_{s=1}^{n-1}\frac{n-s}{n}\left(\widehat{\Gamma_{s}}+\widehat{\Gamma_{s}^{\prime}}\right).
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 This estimator is inconsistent in general, since the number of parameters
 to estimate is more than the number of observations, and increases more
 rapidly than 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, so information does not build up as 
\begin_inset Formula $n\rightarrow\infty.$
\end_inset

 There is always only one observation to estimate the highest order autocovarian

On the other hand, supposing that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{s}$

 tends to zero sufficiently rapidly as 
\begin_inset Formula $s$

\end_inset

 a modified estimator is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\Omega}=\widehat{\Gamma_{0}}+\sum_{s=1}^{q(n)}\left(\widehat{\Gamma_{s}}+\widehat{\Gamma_{s}^{\prime}}\right).
\]

\end_inset

Estimation using conditional moments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far, the moment conditions have been presented as unconditional expectations.
 One common way of defining unconditional moment conditions is based upon
 conditional moment conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that a random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 has zero expectation conditional on the random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{E}_{Y|X}Y=\int Yf(Y|X)dY=0
\]

\end_inset

 Then the unconditional expectation of the product of 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 and a function 
\begin_inset Formula $g(X)$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is also zero.
 
\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset

To see this, the unconditional expectation is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{E}\left(Yg(X)\right)=\int_{\mathcal{X}}\left(\int_{\mathcal{Y}}Yg(X)f(Y,X)dY\right)dX.
\]

\end_inset

 Factor the joint density in to conditional and marginal:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{E}\left(Yg(X)\right)=\int_{\mathcal{X}}\left(\int_{\mathcal{Y}}Yg(X)f(Y|X)f(X)dY\right)dX.
\]

\end_inset

 Because 
\begin_inset Formula $f(X)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g(X)$
\end_inset

 don't depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

, they can be pulled out of the integral 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{E}\left(Yg(X)\right)=\int_{\mathcal{X}}\left(\int_{\mathcal{Y}}Yf(Y|X)dY\right)g(X)f(X)dX.
\]

\end_inset

 But the term in parentheses on the rhs is zero by assumption, so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{E}\left(Yg(X)\right)=0
\]

\end_inset

 as claimed.

\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Exercise
Verify that

\begin_layout Exercise

\begin_inset Newpage newpage

If we accept what is stated in these two exercises, then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D_{n}W_{n}Z^{\prime}X\hat{\theta}_{IV}=D_{n}W_{n}Z^{\prime}y
\]

\end_inset

becomes
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{X^{\prime}Z}{n}\left(\frac{Z^{\prime}Z}{n}\right)^{-1}Z^{\prime}X\hat{\theta}_{IV}=\frac{X^{\prime}Z}{n}\left(\frac{Z^{\prime}Z}{n}\right)^{-1}Z^{\prime}y
\]

\end_inset

Noting that the powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 cancel, we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X^{\prime}Z\left(Z^{\prime}Z\right)^{-1}Z^{\prime}X\hat{\theta}_{IV}=X^{\prime}Z\left(Z^{\prime}Z\right)^{-1}Z^{\prime}y

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{\theta}_{IV}=\left(X^{\prime}Z\left(Z^{\prime}Z\right)^{-1}Z^{\prime}X\right)^{-1}X^{\prime}Z\left(Z^{\prime}Z\right)^{-1}Z^{\prime}y\label{eq:GIV estimator}

Another way of arriving to the same point is to define the projection matrix
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{Z}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{Z}=Z(Z^{\prime}Z)^{-1}Z^{\prime}
\]

\end_inset

 Anything that is projected onto the space spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 will be uncorrelated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon,$
\end_inset

 by the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $Z.$
\end_inset

 Transforming the model with this projection matrix we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{Z}y=P_{Z}X\beta+P_{Z}\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y^{*}=X^{*}\theta+\varepsilon^{*}
\]

\end_inset

 Now we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{*}$
\end_inset

 are uncorrelated, since this is simply 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{E}(X^{*\prime}\varepsilon^{*}) & = & \mathcal{E}(X^{\prime}P_{Z}^{\prime}P_{Z}\varepsilon)\\
 & = & \mathcal{E}(X^{\prime}P_{Z}\varepsilon)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{Z}X=Z(Z^{\prime}Z)^{-1}Z^{\prime}X
\]

\end_inset

 is the fitted value from a regression of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $Z.$
\end_inset

 This is a linear combination of the columns of 
\begin_inset Formula $Z,$
\end_inset

 so it must be uncorrelated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon.$
\end_inset

 This implies that applying OLS to the model 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y^{*}=X^{*}\theta+\varepsilon^{*}
\]

\end_inset

 will lead to a consistent estimator, given a few more assumptions.

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\theta}_{IV} & = & (X^{\prime}P_{Z}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}P_{Z}(X\theta^{0}+\varepsilon)\\
 & = & \theta^{0}+(X^{\prime}P_{Z}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}P_{Z}\varepsilon

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\theta}_{IV}-\theta^{0} & = & (X^{\prime}P_{Z}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}P_{Z}\varepsilon\\

 Now we can introduce factors of

 What about using the GIV estimator? Consider using as instruments

 The lags of

 Actually, a distribution with

 parameters can be uniquely characterized by 
\begin_inset Formula $P$

 However, some sets of

 conditions could be highly correlated.

\[
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}D_{\theta}\ln f(y_{t}|x_{x},\theta)

 We also saw in eqn.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 Unconditional uncorrelation follows from the fact that conditional uncorrelatio

We have seen that inconsistent and the consistent estimators converge to
 different probability limits.
 This is the idea behind the Hausman test - a pair of consistent estimators
 converge to the same probability limit, while if one is consistent and
 the other is not they converge to different limits.
 If we accept that one is consistent (
\emph on
e.g.
\emph default
, the IV estimator), but we are doubting if the other is consistent (
\emph on
e.g.,
\emph default
 the OLS estimator), we might try to check if the difference between the

 Now, let's recall some results from MLE.
 Equation

 The asymptotic covariance of this is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
V_{\infty}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\sqrt{n}\left(\tilde{\theta}-\theta\right)\\
\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\theta}-\theta\right)
\end{array}\right] & = & \begin{bmatrix}I_{K} & 0_{K}\\
0_{K} & I_{\infty}(\theta)^{-1}
\end{bmatrix}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
V_{\infty}(\tilde{\theta}) & I_{K}\\
I_{K} & \mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta)
\end{array}\right]\begin{bmatrix}I_{K} & 0_{K}\\
0_{K} & I_{\infty}(\theta)^{-1}
\end{bmatrix}\\
 & = & \left[\begin{array}{cc}
V_{\infty}(\tilde{\theta}) & I_{\infty}(\theta)^{-1}\\
I_{\infty}(\theta)^{-1} & I_{\infty}(\theta)^{-1}
\end{array}\right],
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

which, for clarity in what follows, we might write as (note to self for
 lectures: the 2,2 element has changed)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V_{\infty}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\sqrt{n}\left(\tilde{\theta}-\theta\right)\\
\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\theta}-\theta\right)
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
V_{\infty}(\tilde{\theta}) & I_{\infty}(\theta)^{-1}\\
I_{\infty}(\theta)^{-1} & V_{\infty}(\hat{\theta})
\end{array}\right].
\]

\end_inset

So, the asymptotic covariance between the MLE and any other CAN estimator
 is equal to the MLE asymptotic variance (the inverse of the information
 matrix).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, suppose we wish to test whether the the two estimators are in fact
 both converging to 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

, versus the alternative hypothesis that the 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

MLE
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

 estimator is not in fact consistent (the consistency of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\theta}$
\end_inset

 is a maintained hypothesis).
 Under the null hypothesis that they are, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{bmatrix}I_{K} & -I_{K}\end{bmatrix}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\sqrt{n}\left(\tilde{\theta}-\theta_{0}\right)\\
\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\theta}-\theta_{0}\right)
\end{array}\right]=\sqrt{n}\left(\tilde{\theta}-\hat{\theta}\right),
\]

\end_inset

will be asymptotically normally distributed as (work out on blackboard)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}\left(\tilde{\theta}-\hat{\theta}\right)\overset{d}{\rightarrow}N\left(0,V_{\infty}(\tilde{\theta})-V_{\infty}(\hat{\theta})\right).
\]

\end_inset

 So, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n\left(\tilde{\theta}-\hat{\theta}\right)^{\prime}\left(V_{\infty}(\tilde{\theta})-V_{\infty}(\hat{\theta})\right)^{-1}\left(\tilde{\theta}-\hat{\theta}\right)\overset{d}{\rightarrow}\chi^{2}(\rho),
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is the rank of the difference of the asymptotic variances.
 A statistic that has the same asymptotic distribution is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\tilde{\theta}-\hat{\theta}\right)^{\prime}\left(\hat{V}(\tilde{\theta})-\hat{V}(\hat{\theta})\right)^{-1}\left(\tilde{\theta}-\hat{\theta}\right)\overset{d}{\rightarrow}\chi^{2}(\rho).
\]

\end_inset

This is the Hausman test statistic, in its original form.
 The reason that this test has power under the alternative hypothesis is
 that in that case the 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

MLE
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

 estimator will not be consistent, and will converge to 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{A}$
\end_inset

, say, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{A}\neq\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Then the mean of the asymptotic distribution of vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}\left(\tilde{\theta}-\hat{\theta}\right)$
\end_inset

 will be 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}-\theta_{A}$
\end_inset

, a non-zero vector, so the test statistic will eventually reject, regardless
 of how small a significance level is used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\infty}(\tilde{\theta})-V_{\infty}(\hat{\theta})$
\end_inset

 may be a singular matrix, in which case the inverse in 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(V_{\infty}(\tilde{\theta})-V_{\infty}(\hat{\theta})\right)^{-1}$
\end_inset

 must be replaced with a generalized inverse.
 This can occur when the two estimators are defined using some common moment
 conditions, which can introduce some linear dependencies between the estimators.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When this is the case, the rank, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, of the difference of the asymptotic variances will be less than the dimension
 of the matrices, and it may be difficult to determine what the true rank
 is.
 If the true rank is lower than what is taken to be true, the test will
 be biased against rejection of the null hypothesis.
 The null is that both estimators are consistent.
 Failure to reject when this hypothesis is false would cause us to use an
 inconsistent estimator: not a desirable outcome! The contrary holds if
 we underestimate the rank.

A solution to this problem is to use a rank 1 test, by comparing only a
 single coefficient.
 For example, if a variable is suspected of possibly being endogenous, that
 variable's coefficients may be compared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Note: if the test is based on a sub-vector of the entire parameter vector
 of the MLE, it is possible that the inconsistency of the MLE will not show
 up in the portion of the vector that has been used.
 If this is the case, the test may not have power to detect the inconsistency.
 This may occur, for example, when the consistent but inefficient estimator
 is not identified for all the parameters of the model, so that we estimate
 only some of the parameters using the inefficient estimator, and the test
 does not include the others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This simple formula only holds when the estimator that is being tested for
 consistency is 
\emph on
fully
\emph default
 efficient under the null hypothesis.
 This means that it must be a ML estimator or a fully efficient estimator
 that has the same asymptotic distribution as the ML estimator.
 This is quite restrictive since modern estimators such as GMM, QML, or
 even OLS with heteroscedastic consistent standard errors are not in general
 fully efficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following up on this last point, let's think of two not necessarily efficient
 estimators, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}_{2}$
\end_inset

, where one is assumed to be consistent, but the other may not be.
 We assume for expositional simplicity that both 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}_{2}$
\end_inset

 belong to the same parameter space, and that each estimator can be expressed
 as generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator.
 The estimators are defined (suppressing the dependence upon data) by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\theta}_{i} & = & \arg\min_{\theta_{i}\in\Theta}\,\bar{m}_{_{i}}(\theta_{i})^{\prime}\,W_{i}\,\bar{m}_{i}(\theta_{i})
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{m}_{i}(\theta_{i})$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}\times1$
\end_inset

 vector of moment conditions, and 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}\times g_{i}$
\end_inset

 positive definite weighting matrix, 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,2.$
\end_inset

 Consider the omnibus GMM estimator
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(\hat{\theta}_{1},\hat{\theta}_{2}\right)=\arg\min_{\Theta\times\Theta}\,\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\bar{m}_{1}(\theta_{1})^{\prime} & \bar{m}_{2}(\theta_{2})^{\prime}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
W_{1} & \mathbf{0}_{\left(g_{1}\times g_{2}\right)}\\
\mathbf{0}_{\left(g_{2}\times g_{1}\right)} & W_{2}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\bar{m}_{1}(\theta_{1})\\
\bar{m}_{2}(\theta_{2})
\end{array}\right].\label{Standard Omnibus}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Suppose that the asymptotic covariance of the omnibus moment vector is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\Sigma & = & \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}Var\left\{ \sqrt{n}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\bar{m}_{1}(\theta_{1})\\
\bar{m}_{2}(\theta_{2})
\end{array}\right]\right\} \label{omnibus variance}\\
 & \equiv & \left(\begin{array}{cc}
\Sigma_{1} & \Sigma_{12}\\
\cdot & \Sigma_{2}
\end{array}\right).\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

The standard Hausman test is equivalent to a Wald test of the equality of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{2}$
\end_inset

 (or subvectors of the two) applied to the omnibus GMM estimator, but with
 the covariance of the moment conditions estimated as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{\Sigma}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\widehat{\Sigma_{1}} & \mathbf{0}_{\left(g_{1}\times g_{2}\right)}\\
\mathbf{0}_{\left(g_{2}\times g_{1}\right)} & \widehat{\Sigma_{2}}
\end{array}\right).
\]

\end_inset

While this is clearly an inconsistent estimator in general, the omitted
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{12}$
\end_inset

 term cancels out of the test statistic when one of the estimators is asymptotic
ally efficient, as we have seen above, and thus it need not be estimated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general solution when neither of the estimators is efficient is clear:
 the entire 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 matrix must be estimated consistently, since the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{12}$
\end_inset

 term will not cancel out.
 Methods for consistently estimating the asymptotic covariance of a vector
 of moment conditions are well-known
\emph on
, e.g.,
\emph default
 the Newey-West estimator discussed previously.
 The Hausman test using a proper estimator of the overall covariance matrix
 will now have an asymptotic 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 distribution when neither estimator is efficient.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the test suffers from a loss of power due to the fact that the
 omnibus GMM estimator of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Standard Omnibus"

\end_inset

 is defined using an inefficient weight matrix.
 A new test can be defined by using an alternative omnibus GMM estimator
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(\hat{\theta}_{1},\hat{\theta}_{2}\right)=\arg\min_{\Theta\times\Theta}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\bar{m}_{1}(\theta_{1})^{\prime} & \bar{m}_{2}(\theta_{2})^{\prime}\end{array}\right]\left(\widetilde{\Sigma}\right)^{-1}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\bar{m}_{1}(\theta_{1})\\
\bar{m}_{2}(\theta_{2})
\end{array}\right],\label{New Omnibus}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\widetilde{\Sigma}$
\end_inset

 is a consistent estimator of the overall covariance matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "omnibus variance"

\end_inset

.
 By standard arguments, this is a more efficient estimator than that defined
 by equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, so the Wald test using this alternative is more powerful.

Though GMM estimation has many applications, application to rational expectation
s models is elegant, since theory directly suggests the moment conditions.
 Hansen and Singleton's 1982 paper is also a classic worth studying in itself.
 Though I strongly recommend reading the paper, I'll use a simplified model
 with notation similar to Hamilton's.
 The literature on estimation of these models has grown a lot since these
 early papers.
 After work like the cited papers, people moved to ML estimation of linearized
 models, using Kalman filtering.
 Current methods are usually Bayesian, and involve sophisticated filtering
 methods to compute the likelihood function for nonlinear models with non-normal
 shocks.
 There is a lot of interesting stuff that is beyond the scope of this course.
 I have done some work using simulation-based estimation methods applied
 to such models.
 The methods explained in this section are intended to provide an example
 of GMM estimation.
 They are not the state of the art for estimation of such models.

We assume a representative consumer maximizes expected discounted utility
 over an infinite horizon.
 Expectations are rational, and the agent has full information (is fully
 aware of the history of the world up to the current time period - how's
 that for an assumption!).
 Utility is temporally additive, and the expected utility hypothesis holds.
 The future consumption stream is the stochastic sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ c_{t}\right\} _{t=0}^{\infty}.$
\end_inset

 The objective function at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

Suppose the consumer can invest in a risky asset.
 A dollar invested in the asset yields a gross return 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(1+r_{t+1})=\frac{p_{t+1}+d_{t+1}}{p_{t}}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the price and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the dividend in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t.$
\end_inset

 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 is the net return on a dollar invested in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

A partial set of necessary conditions for utility maximization have the
 form: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
u^{\prime}(c_{t})=\beta\mathcal{E}\left\{ \left(1+r_{t+1}\right)u^{\prime}(c_{t+1})|I_{t}\right\} .\label{foc}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 To see that the condition is necessary, suppose that the lhs < rhs.
 Then by reducing current consumption marginally would cause equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "umax"

\end_inset

 to drop by 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\prime}(c_{t}),$
\end_inset

 since there is no discounting of the current period.
 At the same time, the marginal reduction in consumption finances investment,
 which has gross return 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1+r_{t+1}\right),$
\end_inset

 which could finance consumption in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1.$
\end_inset

 This increase in consumption would cause the objective function to increase
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\mathcal{E}\left\{ \left(1+r_{t+1}\right)u^{\prime}(c_{t+1})|I_{t}\right\} .$
\end_inset

 Therefore, unless the condition holds, the expected discounted utility
 function is not maximized.

To use this we need to choose the functional form of utility.
 A constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) form is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u(c_{t})=\frac{c_{t}^{1-\gamma}-1}{1-\gamma}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is the coefficient of relative risk aversion.
 With this form, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u^{\prime}(c_{t})=c_{t}^{-\gamma}
\]

\end_inset

 so the foc are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c_{t}^{-\gamma}=\beta\mathcal{E}\left\{ \left(1+r_{t+1}\right)c_{t+1}^{-\gamma}|I_{t}\right\} 
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset

 While it is true that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{E}\left(c_{t}^{-\gamma}-\beta\left\{ \left(1+r_{t+1}\right)c_{t+1}^{-\gamma}\right\} \right)|I_{t}=0
\]

\end_inset

 so that we could use this to define moment conditions, it is unlikely that
 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 is stationary, even though it is in real terms, and our theory requires
 stationarity.
 To solve this, divide though by 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}^{-\gamma}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{E}\left(\textrm{1-}\beta\left\{ \left(1+r_{t+1}\right)\left(\frac{c_{t+1}}{c_{t}}\right)^{-\gamma}\right\} \right)|I_{t}=0
\]

\end_inset

 (note that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 can be passed though the conditional expectation since 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 is chosen based only upon information available in time 
\begin_inset Formula $t).$
\end_inset

 That is to say, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 is in the information set 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{t}$

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\textrm{1-}\beta\left\{ \left(1+r_{t+1}\right)\left(\frac{c_{t+1}}{c_{t}}\right)^{-\gamma}\right\}

\end_inset

is analogous to 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{t}(\theta)$
\end_inset

 defined above: it's a scalar moment condition that has conditional expectation
 equal to zero.
 To get a vector of moment conditions we need some instruments.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{z}_{t}$
\end_inset

 is a vector of variables drawn from the information set 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{t}.$
\end_inset

 We can use the necessary conditions to form the expressions 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{c}
\left[1-\beta\left(1+r_{t+1}\right)\left(\frac{c_{t+1}}{c_{t}}\right)^{-\gamma}\right]\mathbf{z}_{t}\end{array}\equiv m_{t}(\theta)

Note that at time

 has been observed, and is therefore an element of the information set.
 By rational expectations, the autocovariances of the moment conditions
 other than 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{0}$
\end_inset

 should be zero.
 The optimal weighting matrix is therefore the inverse of the variance of
 the moment conditions: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Omega_{_{\infty}}=\lim E\left[n\bar{m}(\theta^{0})\bar{m}(\theta^{0})^{\prime}\right]
\]

 which can be consistently estimated by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\Omega}=1/n\sum_{t=1}^{n}m_{t}(\hat{\theta})m_{t}(\hat{\theta})^{\prime}
\]

\end_inset

 As before, this estimate depends on an initial consistent estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta,$
\end_inset

 which can be obtained by setting the weighting matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 arbitrarily (to an identity matrix, for example).
 After obtaining 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta},$
\end_inset

 we then minimize 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s(\theta)=\bar{m}(\theta)^{\prime}\hat{\Omega}^{-1}\bar{m}(\theta).
\]

\end_inset

 This process can be iterated, e.g., use the new estimate to re-estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega,$
\end_inset

 use this to estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{0},$
\end_inset

 and repeat until the estimates don't change.

In principle, we could use a very large number of moment conditions in estimatio
n, since 
\emph on
any current or lagged variable

 could be used in

 Since use of more moment conditions will lead to a more (asymptotically)
 efficient estimator, one might be tempted to use many instrumental variables.
 We will do a computer lab that will show that this may not be a good idea
 with finite samples.
 This issue has been studied using Monte Carlos (Tauchen,

 The reason for poor performance when using many instruments is that the

Pretty clearly, the results are sensitive to the choice of instruments.
 Also, if you examine the objective function values, it seems unlikely that
 the global minimum was found in all cases, probably multiple start values
 or global minimization are needed.
 Maybe there is some problem here: poor instruments, or possibly a conditional
 moment that is not very informative.
 Moment conditions formed from Euler conditions sometimes do not identify
 the parameter of a model.

From the first order conditions of the model, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
w_{t} & = & \psi\eta_{t}c_{t}^{\gamma}\\
\eta_{t} & = & \frac{w_{t}}{\psi c_{t}^{\gamma}}\\
\ln\eta_{t} & = & \ln w_{t}-\ln\psi-\gamma\ln c_{t}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

The real values of this shock are not observed, but, given a guess for the
 parameters and the data, the left hand side of the above equation can be
 calculated.
 Also, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ln\eta_{t}=\rho\ln\eta_{t-1}+\sigma_{\eta}\epsilon_{t}.
\]

\end_inset

So, we can regress the calculated 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln\eta_{t}$
\end_inset

 on their lags.
 The FOC for the OLS estimator set the mean of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u_{t}=\ln\eta_{t-1}[\ln\eta_{t}-\rho_{\eta}\ln\eta_{t-1}]
\]

\end_inset

 to zero.
 At the true parameter values, this expression has mean zero, so it can
 be used to define a moment condition.
 We also have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left(u_{t}^{2}-\sigma_{\eta}^{2}\right)=0
\]

\end_inset

 at the true parameters, so this gives us a second moment condition.
 These two moment conditions are informative for all of the parameters that
 enter into their definitions: 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma,\rho_{\eta},\sigma_{\eta}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 But 
\begin_inset Formula $r=MPK,$

 so
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left(\beta\cdot c_{t+1}^{-\gamma}\left[1+r_{t+1}-\delta\right]\right)-c_{t}^{-\gamma}=0

Thus,

y_{t}^{*} & = & \alpha+\rho y_{t-1}^{*}+\beta x_{t}+\epsilon_{t}\\
y_{t} & = & y_{t}^{*}+\upsilon_{t}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon_{t}$

 are independent Gaussian white noise errors.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is not observed, and instead we observe 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 We can estimate the equation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=\alpha+\rho y_{t-1}+\beta x_{t}+\nu_{t}
\]

using GIV, as was done above.

Up to now we've considered the behavior of the dependent variable 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 as a function of other variables 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}.$
\end_inset

 These variables can of course contain lagged dependent variables, e.g., 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}=(w_{t},y_{t-1},...,y_{t-j}).$
\end_inset

 Pure time series methods consider the behavior of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 as a function only of its own lagged values, unconditional on other observable
 variables.
 One can think of this as modeling the behavior of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 after marginalizing out all other variables.
 But, of course, general models will include lagged dependent variables
 and other explanatory variables.
 This Chapter gives a brief description of some of the widely used models.

\begin_layout Definition
[Stochastic process]
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "Stochastic process"

\end_inset

 A stochastic process is a sequence of random variables, indexed by time:
 
\begin_inset Formula $\{Y_{t}\}_{t=-\infty}^{\infty}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\,$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Definition
[Time series]
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "Time series"

\end_inset

 A time series is 
\series bold
one
\series default
 observation of a stochastic process, over a specific interval: 
\begin_inset Formula $\{y_{t}\}_{t=1}^{n}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So a time series is a sample of size 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 from a stochastic process.
 It's important to keep in mind that conceptually, one could draw another
 sample, and that the values would be different.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
[Autocovariance] The 
\begin_inset Formula $j^{th}$
\end_inset

 autocovariance of a stochastic process is 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{jt}=\mathcal{E}(y_{t}-\mu_{t})(y_{t-j}-\mu_{t-j})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{t}=\mathcal{E}\left(y_{t}\right).$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Definition
[Covariance (weak) stationarity] A stochastic process is covariance stationary
 if it has time constant mean and autocovariances of all orders: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mu_{t} & =\mu, & \forall t\\
\gamma_{jt} & =\gamma_{j}, & \forall t
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we've seen, this implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{j}=\gamma_{-j}:$
\end_inset

 the autocovariances depend only one the interval between observations,
 but not the time of the observations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
[Strong stationarity] A stochastic process is strongly stationary if the
 joint distribution of an arbitrary collection of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ Y_{t}\right\} $
\end_inset

, e.g., 
\begin_inset Formula $(Y_{t-j},Y_{t-k},...,Y_{t},...,Y_{t+l},Y_{t+m}\}$
\end_inset

, doesn't depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $t.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since moments are determined by the distribution, strong stationarity
\begin_inset Formula $\Rightarrow$
\end_inset

weak stationarity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Newpage newpage

How can we estimate the mean of 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{t}?$

 The time series is one sample from the stochastic process, and each of
 the random variables over the sample interval is sampled only once.
 One could think of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 repeated samples from the stoch.
 proc., e.g., 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ y_{tm}\right\} _{m=1}^{M}$

 By a LLN, we would expect that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^{M}y_{tm}\overset{p}{\rightarrow}\mathcal{E}(Y_{t})

\end_inset

as 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 gets large.
 The problem is, we have only one sample to work with, since we can't go
 back in time and collect another.
 How can 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}(Y_{t})$

 be estimated then? It turns out that

\begin_layout Definition
[Ergodicity].
 A stationary stochastic process is ergodic (for the mean) if the time average
 converges to the mean
\begin_inset Formula

\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}y_{t}\overset{p}{\rightarrow}\mu
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A sufficient condition for ergodicity is that the autocovariances be absolutely
 summable: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}|\gamma_{j}|<\infty
\]

\end_inset

This implies that the autocovariances die off, so that the 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 are not so strongly dependent that they don't satisfy a LLN.

\begin_layout Section
ARMA models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With these concepts, we can discuss ARMA models.
 These are closely related to the AR and MA error processes that we've already
 discussed.
 The main difference is that the lhs variable is observed directly now.
\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
MA(q) processes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{th}$
\end_inset

 order moving average (MA) process is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=\mu+\varepsilon_{t}+\theta_{1}\varepsilon_{t-1}+\theta_{2}\varepsilon_{t-2}+\cdots+\theta_{q}\varepsilon_{t-q}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 is white noise.
 The variance is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\gamma_{0} & = & \mathcal{E}\left(y_{t}-\mu\right)^{2}\\
 & = & \mathcal{E}\left(\varepsilon_{t}+\theta_{1}\varepsilon_{t-1}+\theta_{2}\varepsilon_{t-2}+\cdots+\theta_{q}\varepsilon_{t-q}\right)^{2}\\
 & = & \sigma^{2}\left(1+\theta_{1}^{2}+\theta_{2}^{2}+\cdots+\theta_{q}^{2}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 Similarly, the autocovariances are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\gamma_{j} & = & \mathcal{E}\left[\left(y_{t}-\mu\right)\left(y_{t-j}-\mu\right)\right]\\
 & = & \sigma^{2}(\theta_{j}+\theta_{j+1}\theta_{1}+\theta_{j+2}\theta_{2}+\cdots+\theta_{q}\theta_{q-j}),j\leq q\\
 & = & 0,j>q
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 Therefore an MA(q) process is necessarily covariance stationary and ergodic,
 as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 and all of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{j}$
\end_inset

 are finite.
\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if we have an MA(1) model, then 
\begin_inset Formula $E(y_{t})=\mu$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $V(y_{t})=\sigma^{2}(1+\theta_{1}^{2})$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1}=\sigma^{2}\theta_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 The higher order autocovariances are zero.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Thus, if the model is MA(1) with normally distributed shocks, the density
 of the vector of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 observations, 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
f_{Y}(y|\rho) & =\frac{\text{1}}{\sqrt{\left(2\pi\right)^{n}\left|\Sigma\right|}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(y-\mu\right)^{\prime}\Sigma^{-1}\left(y-\mu\right)\right)\label{eq:MA1likelihood}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Sigma=\sigma^{2}\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
1+\theta_{1}^{2} & \theta_{1} & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
\theta_{1} & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots\\
0 & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & 0\\
\vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \theta_{1}\\
0 & \cdots & 0 & \theta_{1} & 1+\theta_{1}^{2}
\end{array}\right].
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
With this, it is very easy to program the log-likelihood function.
 For higher order MA models, the only difference is the structure of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 becomes more complicated.
 In this form, one needs a lot of computer memory.
 A more economical approach uses the Kalman filter, which we'll see in the
 discussion of state space models.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\end_inset

 and

\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{t}+1$

\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}(1)$
\end_inset

.
 Do estimation by GMM, and verify experimentally (by increasing the sample
 size) that the estimator is consistent.

\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 as the square of a standard normal, minus 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Exercise
\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An issue to be aware of is that MA models are not identified, in that there
 exist multiple parameter values that give the same value of the likelihood
 function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For example, the MA(1) model with 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\sigma}^{2}=\theta^{2}\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\theta}_{1}=\frac{1}{\theta_{1}}$
\end_inset

 has identical first and second moments to the original model, so the likelihood
 function has the same value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Normally, the parameterization that leads to an 
\emph on
invertible
\emph default
 MA model is the one that is selected.
 An invertible MA model is one that has a representation as a AR(
\begin_inset Formula $\infty)$
\end_inset

 model.
 For the MA(1) model, the invertible parameterization has 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\theta_{1}\right|<1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This implies that parameter restrictions will need to be imposed when estimating
 the MA model, to enforce selection of the invertible model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Maximization of the conditional likelihood is also used for estimation,
 sometimes.
 Assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{0}$
\end_inset

 is known (for example, equal to zero), then one can compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{1}$
\end_inset

, given the parameters.
 Then one works forward recursively to get all of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 With these, the likelihood function is very easy to compute.
 This is a convenient shortcut, but it's not recommended if the sample is
 not large, especially since it's not hard to compute the exact likelihood
 function.

\]

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 is white noise.
 This is just a linear regression model, and assuming stationarity, we can
 estimate the parameters by OLS.
 What is needed for stationarity?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dynamic behavior of an AR(p) process can be studied by writing this
 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{th}$

 order difference equation as a vector first order difference equation (this
 is known as the companion form): 
\begin_inset Formula

 or 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y_{t}=C+FY_{t-1}+E_{t}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset

 With this, we can recursively work forward in time: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_{t+1} & = & C+FY_{t}+E_{t+1}\\
 & = & C+F\left(C+FY_{t-1}+E_{t}\right)+E_{t+1}\\
 & = & C+FC+F^{2}Y_{t-1}+FE_{t}+E_{t+1}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_{t+2} & = & C+FY_{t+1}+E_{t+2}\\
 & = & C+F\left(C+FC+F^{2}Y_{t-1}+FE_{t}+E_{t+1}\right)+E_{t+2}\\
 & = & C+FC+F^{2}C+F^{3}Y_{t-1}+F^{2}E_{t}+FE_{t+1}+E_{t+2}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 or in general 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y_{t+j}=C+FC+\cdots+F^{j}C+F^{j+1}Y_{t-1}+F^{j}E_{t}+F^{j-1}E_{t+1}+\cdots+FE_{t+j-1}+E_{t+j}
\]

\begin_inset Newpage newpage

 Consider the impact of a shock in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t+j}.$
\end_inset

 This is simply 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial Y_{t+j}}{\partial E_{t}^{\prime}}_{(1,1)}=F_{(1,1)}^{j}
\]

\end_inset

 If the system is to be stationary, then as we move forward in time this
 impact must die off.
 Otherwise a shock causes a permanent change in the mean of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}.$
\end_inset

 Therefore, stationarity requires that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{j\rightarrow\infty}F_{(1,1)}^{j}=0

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the eigenvalues of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $F.$
\end_inset

 These are the 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
|F-\lambda I_{P}|=0
\]

\end_inset

 The determinant here can be expressed as a polynomial.
 For example, for 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1,$
\end_inset

 the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is simply 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F=\phi_{1}
\]

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
|\phi_{1}-\lambda|=0
\]

\end_inset

 can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\phi_{1}-\lambda=0
\]

\end_inset

 When 
\begin_inset Formula $p=2,$
\end_inset

 the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
\phi_{1} & \phi_{2}\\
1 & 0
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F-\lambda I_{P}=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
\phi_{1}-\lambda & \phi_{2}\\
1 & -\lambda
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
|F-\lambda I_{P}|=\lambda^{2}-\lambda\phi_{1}-\phi_{2}
\]

\end_inset

 So the eigenvalues are the roots of the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda^{2}-\lambda\phi_{1}-\phi_{2}
\]

\end_inset

 which can be found using the quadratic equation.
 This generalizes.
 For a 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{th}$
\end_inset

 order AR process, the eigenvalues are the roots of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda^{p}-\lambda^{p-1}\phi_{1}-\lambda^{p-2}\phi_{2}-\cdots-\lambda\phi_{p-1}-\phi_{p}=0
\]

\begin_inset Formula $F,$
\end_inset

 Using this decomposition, we can write 
\begin_inset Formula

\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $T\Lambda T^{-1}$

 Supposing that the

\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

 requires that 
\begin_inset Formula

 e.g., the eigenvalues must be less than one in absolute value.

 Assuming stationarity, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}(y_{t})=\mu,\forall t,$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu=c+\phi_{1}\mu+\phi_{2}\mu+...+\phi_{p}\mu

 The autocovariances of orders

 Assume that we have

 This is a

 model, of order 1 - commonly referred to as a VAR(1) model.
 It is a collection of

 AR(1) models, augmented to include lags of other endogenous variables,
 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $G$

\begin_layout Itemize
As shown in Section

 there is no need to use GLS, in spite of the cross equation correlations.

\begin_layout Standard
A VAR model of this form can be thought of as the reduced form of a dynamic
 simultaneous equations system, with all of the variables treated as endogenous,
 and with lags of all of the endogenous variables present:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The simultaneous equations model is (see equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y_{t}^{\prime}\Gamma=X_{t}^{\prime}B+E_{t}^{\prime}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
this can be written after transposing (and adapting notation to use small
 case, pulling the constant out of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

 and using 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{t}$
\end_inset

 for the error) as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{\prime}y_{t}=a+B^{\prime}x_{t}+v_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}=y_{t-1}.$
\end_inset

 Then we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{\prime}y_{t}=a+B^{\prime}y_{t-1}+v_{t}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Premultiplying by the inverse of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{\prime}$

 gives

C.
 Sims originally proposed reduced form VAR models as an alternative to structura
l simultaneous equations models, which were perceived to require too many
 unrealistic assumptions for their identification.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
However, the search for structural interpretations of VAR models slowly
 crept back into the literature, leading to 
\begin_inset Quotes sld

structural VARs

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A structural VAR model is really just a certain form of dynamic linear simultane

 methods used for identification.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The issue of identifying the structural parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is more or less the same problem that was studied in the context of simultaneou
s equations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There, identification was obtained through zero restrictions.
 In the structural VAR literature, zero restrictions are often used, but
 other information may also be used, such as covariance matrix restrictions
 or sign restrictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Interest often focuses on the impulse-response functions.
 Identification of the impact of structural shocks (how to estimate the
 impact-response functions) is complicated, with many alternative methodologies,
 and is often a topic of much disagreement among practitioners.
 The estimated impulse response functions are often sensitive to the identificat
ion strategy that is used.
 There is a large literature.

An issue which arises when a VAR(p) model 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}=C+A_{1}y_{t-1}+\cdots+A_{p}y_{t-p}+\epsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 is contemplated is that the number of parameters increases rapidly in p,
 which introduces severe collinearity problems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One can use Bayesian methods such as the 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

Minnesota prior
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

 (search for papers by Litterman), which is a prior that each variable separatel
y follows a random walk (an AR(1) model with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=1)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The prior on 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 is that it is an identity matrix
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
and the prior on the 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{j},\,j>1$
\end_inset

 is that they are zero matrices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
thus, each variable follows a random walk, according to the prior
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
This can be done using stochastic restrictions similar to what was in the
 discussion of collinearity and ridge regression.
 For example, a VAR(2) model in de-meaned variables, with 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 variables, can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
Y_{-1} & Y_{-2}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
A_{1}\\
A_{2}
\end{array}\right]+\epsilon
\]

\end_inset

We can impose the stochastic restriction that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=I_{2}-v_{1}$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}=0_{2}-v_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Augmenting the data with these 4 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

artificial observations
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

, we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
Y\\
I_{G}\\
0_{G}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
Y_{-1} & Y_{-2}\\
I_{G} & 0_{G}\\
0_{G} & I_{G}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
A_{1}\\
A_{2}
\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{c}
\epsilon\\
v_{1}\\
v_{2}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

Then we can impose how important the restrictions are by weighting the stochasti
c restrictions, along the lines of a GLS heteroscedasticity correction:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
Y\\
k_{1}I_{G}\\
0_{G}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
Y_{-1} & Y_{-2}\\
k_{1}I_{G} & 0_{G}\\
0_{G} & k_{2}I_{G}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
A_{1}\\
A_{2}
\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{c}
\epsilon\\
k_{1}v_{1}\\
k_{2}v_{2}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

Then we fit by OLS.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}$
\end_inset

 is large, the estimated 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 will be forced to be close to an identity matrix.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{2}$
\end_inset

 is large, the second lag coefficients are all forced to zero.
 Jointly, these restrictions push the model in the direction of separate
 random walks for each variable.
 The degree to which the model is pushed depends on the 
\begin_inset Formula $ks$
\end_inset

.
 When the 
\begin_inset Formula $ks$
\end_inset

 are small, the fit is close to the unrestricted OLS fit, when they are
 large, it is close to separate random walks.

ARCH (autoregressive conditionally heteroscedastic) models appeared in the
 literature in 1982, in Engle, Robert F.
 (1982).
 "Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity with Estimates of Variance
 of United Kingdom Inflation", Econometrica 50:987-1008.
 This paper stimulated a very large growth in the literature for a number

 are Gaussian white noise shocks.
 The ARCH variance is a moving average process.
 Previous large shocks to the series cause the conditional variance of the
 series to increase.
 There is no leverage: negative shocks have the same impact on the future
 variance as do positive shocks.

In principle, this is easy to maximize.
 Some complications can arise when the restrictions for positivity and stationar

 Consider a fairly short data series with low volatility in the initial
 part, and high volatility at the end.
 This data appears to have a nonstationary variance sequence.
 If one attempts to estimate and ARCH model with stationarity imposed, the

 maximization of the likelihood function difficult.

GARCH

\begin_layout Standard
Note that an ARCH model specifies the variance process as a moving average.
 For the same reason that an ARMA model may be used to parsimoniously model
 a series instead of a high order AR or MA, one can do the same thing for
 the variance series.
 A basic GARCH(p,q) (Bollerslev, Tim (1986).
 "Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity", Journal of
 Econometrics, 31:307-327) specification is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
y_{t} & =\mu+\rho y_{t-1}+\epsilon_{t}\\
\epsilon_{t} & =\sigma_{t}u_{t}\\

\end{align*}

\end_inset

The idea is that a GARCH model with low values of p and q may fit the data
 as well or better than an ARCH model with large q.

There are some minor differences, because the Julia code initializes the

Stochastic volatility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In ARCH and GARCH models, the same shocks that affect the level also affect
 the variance.
 The stochastic volatility model allows the variance to have its own random
 component.
 A simple example is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
y_{t} & =\sigma_{\epsilon}\exp(h_{t}/2)\epsilon_{t}\\
h_{t} & =\rho h_{t-1}+\sigma_{u}u_{t}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

In this model, the log of the variance of the observed sequence follows
 an AR(1) model.
 Once can introduce leverage by allowing correlation between 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t}.$
\end_inset

 A mini-package that let's you generate data from this model is here:

While the ARCH and GARCH models have a link between the shocks to 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 and the dynamics of the variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

, the stochastic volatility model has latent shocks to the variance which
 are not directly linked to the observed dependent variable.
 This may be perfectly reasonable: even when volatility is high, the mean
 of shocks to the observables may be zero.
 An ARCH model could not account for an increase in volatility without having
 a realized extreme shock to the level.
 The SV model can allow for this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The latent shocks complicate estimation.
 Many estimation methods have been proposed, and this sort of model helped
 to popularize Bayesian methods in econometrics: see Jacquier, E., Polson,
 N.G.
 and Rossi, P.E., 2002.

 estimation.

Diffusion models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Financial data is often modeled using a continuous time specification.
 An example is the following model, taken from a paper of mine (JEF, 2015,
 with D.
 Kristensen).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A basic model is a simple continuous time stochastic volatility model with
 leverage.
 Log price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}=\log\left(P_{t}\right)$
\end_inset

, solves the following pure diffusion model,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dp_{t}=\left(\mu_{0}+\mu_{1}\text{\exp}\left(h_{t}-\alpha\right)\right)dt+\text{\exp}\left(\frac{h_{t}}{2}\right)dW_{1,t}
\]

\end_inset

where the spot volatility (the instantaneous variance of returns), 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp(h_{t})$
\end_inset

 is modeled using its logarithm:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dh_{t}=\kappa(\alpha-h_{t})dt+\sigma dW_{2,t}.
\]

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1,t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{2,t}$
\end_inset

 are two standard Brownian motions with instantaneous correlation 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=Cov\left(dW_{1,t},dW_{2,t}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The parameters are interpreted as follows: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the baseline drift of returns; 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{1}$
\end_inset

 allows drift to depend upon spot volatility; 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the mean of log volatility; 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 is the speed of mean reversion of log volatility, such that low values
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 imply high persistence of log volatility; 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is the so-called volatility of volatility; and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is a leverage parameter that affects the correlation between returns and
 log volatility.
 We collect the parameters in 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=\left(\mu_{0},\mu_{1},\alpha,\kappa,\sigma,\rho\right)$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An extension is to add jumps to the above model.
 These occur with Poisson frequency, and are conditionally normally distributed.
 More specifically, log-price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}$
\end_inset

 solves the following continuous-time jump-diffusion model,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dp_{t}=\left(\mu_{0}+\mu_{1}\text{\exp}\left(h_{t}/2\right)\right)dt+\text{\exp}\left(\frac{h_{t}}{2}\right)dW_{1,t}+J_{t}dN_{t}.
\]

\end_inset

The Poisson process 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{t}$
\end_inset

 counts the number of jumps up to time 
\begin_inset Formula $t,$
\end_inset

 and has jump intensity 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{t}=\lambda_{0}+\lambda_{1}\text{\exp}\left(h_{t}-\alpha\right)$
\end_inset

 that varies with the volatility, while jump sizes, conditional on the occurrenc
e of a jump, are independent and conditionally normally distributed: 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{t}\sim N(\mu_{J},\sigma_{J}^{2})$
\end_inset

.
 The inclusion of the jump component adds four parameters to 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 as defined above, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{J}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{J}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 This jump model was considered in, for example, Andersen, Benzoni and Lund
 (2002).

 model is not the same as the true transition density 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{t}\sim f_{p}\left(p_{t}|p_{t-1},h_{t-1};\theta\right),

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This true density is unknown, however, so using it for ML estimation is
 not possible.
 If one estimates the discrete time version treating it as the actual density,
 there is an approximation misspecification that causes the estimates to
 be inconsistent: we're not doing ML, we're doing quasi-ML, which is in
 general an inconsistent estimator.

State space models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For linear time series models with Gaussian shocks, it is often useful to
 put the model in state space form, as in this form, the Kalman filter provides
 a convenient way to compute the likelihood function.
 For example, with an MA model, we can compute the likelihood function using
 the joint density of the whole sample, 
\begin_inset Formula $y\sim N(0,\Sigma$
\end_inset

) where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 is an 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix that depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

,  The log likelihood is 
\begin_inset Formula $f(y|\sigma^{2},\phi)$
\end_inset

, as in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:MA1likelihood"

\end_inset

.
 That form of writing the likelihood uses a lot of computer memory, as the
 entire 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 matrix must be stored.
 A more efficient method is to write the MA model as a linear Gaussian state-spa
ce model, and to use Kalman filtering to compute the likelihood.

There is a true unknown parameter vector,

\begin_inset Formula $\pi(\theta)$
\end_inset

, which is known as the 
\emph on
prior
\emph default
, reflects current beliefs about the parameter, before observing the sample.
 It is assumed that the econometrician can provide this density.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We also have sample information, 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

=
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ y_{1},y_{2},...y_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 We're already familiar with the 
\emph on
likelihood function,
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(y|\theta)$
\end_inset

, which is the density of the sample given a parameter value.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given these two pieces, we can write the joint density of the sample and
 the beliefs:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(y,\theta)=f(y|\theta)\pi(\theta)
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset

We can get the 
\emph on
marginal likelihood 
\emph default
by integrating out the parameter, integrating over its support 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta$
\end_inset

:
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(y)=\int_{\Theta}f(y,\theta)d\theta
\]

\end_inset


\emph default
The last step is to get the 
\emph on
posterior 
\emph default
of the parameter.
 This is simply the density of the parameter conditional on the sample,
 and we get it in the normal way we get a conditional density, using Bayes'
 theorem:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(\theta|y)=\frac{f(y,\theta)}{f(y)}=\frac{f(y|\theta)\pi(\theta)}{f(y)}
\]

So far, this is pretty straightforward.
 The complications are mostly computational.
 To illustrate, the posterior mean is

Philosophy, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, the classical paradigm views the data as generated by a data generating
 process, which is a perhaps unknown model characterized by a parameter
 vector, and the data is generated from the model at a particular value
 of the parameter vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Bayesians view data as given, and update beliefs about a parameter using
 the information about the parameter contained in the data.
 There's nothing obviously contradictory in these views.
 Nevertheless, it's not hard to find discussions where there are disagreements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, I'm trying to address a model with a fixed non-random parameter about
 which we would like to learn.
 As long as the object of interest - the dgp and it's parameter - is agreed
 upon, then we can contemplate using any convenient tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if one is a strict frequentist, one shouldn't reinvent the wheel each
 time we get a new sample: previous samples have information about the parameter
, and we should use all of the available information.
 A pure frequentist 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

full information
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

 approach would require writing the joint likelihood of all samples, which
 would almost certainly constitute an impossible task.
 The Bayesian approach concentrates all of the information coming from previous
 work in the form of a prior.
 A fairly simple, easy to use prior may not 
\emph on
exactly
\emph default
 capture all previous information, but it could offer a handy and reasonably
 accurate summary, and it's almost certainly better than simply pretending
 that all of that previous information simply doesn't exist.
 So, the idea of a prior as a summary of what we have learned may simply
 be viewed as a practical solution to the problem of using all the available
 information.
 Given that it's a summary, one may as well use a convenient form, as long
 as it's plausible and the results don't depend too exaggeratedly particular
 form used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As long as one takes the view that there is a fixed unknown parameter value
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

 which generates all samples, then frequentist and Bayesian methods are
 trying to inform us about the same object, and the choice between tools
 may become one of convenience.
 It turns out that one can analyze Bayesian estimators from a classical
 (frequentist) perspective.
 It also turns out that Bayesian estimators may be easier to compute reliably
 than analogous classical estimators.
 These computational advantages, combined with the ability to use information
 from previous work in an intelligent way, make the study of Bayesian methods
 attractive for frequentists.
 If a Bayesian takes the view that there is a fixed data generating process,
 and Bayesian learning leads in the limit to the same fixed true value that
 frequentists posit, then the study of frequentist theory will be useful
 to a Bayesian practitioner.
 For example, the GMM estimator is closely related to some versions of 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Approximate Bayesian Computing"
target "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_Bayesian_computation"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 (ABC).
 Thus, knowledge of theory and practical experience with GMM can be a useful
 guide to implementing ABC estimators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For the rest of this, I will adopt the classical, frequentist perspective,
 and study the behavior of Bayesian estimators in this context.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One should note that the traditional Bayesian approach requires the likelihood
 function, just as is the case with ML.
 Thus, it uses

, for a given model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are Bayesian methods for choosing between models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 When the sample is small, the likelihood function has less weight, and
 more of the information comes from the prior.
 When the sample is larger, the likelihood function will have more weight,

 is a very interesting article that shows how Bayesian methods may be used
 with criterion functions that are associated with classical estimation
 techniques.
 For example, it is possible to compute a posterior mean version of a GMM
 estimator.
 Chernozhukov and Hong provide their Theorem 2, which proves consistency
 and asymptotic normality for a general class of such estimators.
 When the criterion function 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{n}(\theta)$
\end_inset

 in their paper is set to the log-likelihood function, the pseudo-prior
 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(\theta)$
\end_inset

 is a real Bayesian prior, and the penalty function 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the squared loss function (see the paper), then the class of estimators
 discussed by CH reduces to the ordinary Bayesian posterior mean.
 As such, their Theorem 2, in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Chernozhukov-and-Hong,"

\end_inset

 tells us that this estimator is consistent and asymptotically normally
 distributed.
 In particular, the Bayesian posterior mean has the same asymptotic distribution
 as does the ordinary maximum likelihood estimator.

the intuition is clear: as the amount of information coming from the sample
 increases, the likelihood function brings an increasing amount of information,
 relative to the prior.
 Eventually, the prior is no longer important for determining the shape
 of the posterior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
when the sample is large, the shape of the posterior depends on the likelihood
 function.
 The likelihood function collapses around 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

 when the sample is generated at 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}.$
\end_inset

 The same is true of the posterior, it narrows around 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 This causes the posterior mean to converge to the true parameter value.
 In fact, all quantiles of the posterior converge to 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Chernozhukov and Hong discuss estimators defined using quantiles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For an econometrician coming from the frequentist perspective, this is attractiv
e.
 The Bayesian estimator has the same asymptotic behavior as the MLE.
 There may be computational advantages to using the Bayesian approach, because
 there is no need for optimization.
 If the objective function that defines the classical estimator is irregular
 (multiple local optima, nondifferentiabilities, noncontinuities...), then
 optimization may be very difficult.
 However, Bayesian methods that use integration may be more tractable.
 This is the main motivation of CH's paper.
 Additional advantages include the benefits if an informative prior is available.
 When this is the case, the Bayesian estimator can have better small sample
 performance than the maximum likelihood estimator.

\begin_layout Itemize
The prior density is 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(\theta)$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\theta^{*};\theta^{s})$

 be a proposal density, which describes the density of a trial value 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{*}$
\end_inset

 conditional on starting at 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{s}$
\end_inset

.
 It must be possible to sample from the proposal.
 This gives a new trial parameter value 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{*}$
\end_inset

, given the most recently accepted parameter value 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{s}$
\end_inset

 A proposal will be accepted if
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{f(\theta^{*}|y)}{f(\theta^{s}|y)}\frac{g(\theta^{s};\theta^{*})}{g(\theta^{*};\theta^{s})}>\alpha
\]

\end_inset

where

\begin_layout Standard
There are two parts to the numerator and denominator: the posterior, and
 the proposal density.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Focusing on the numerator, when the trial value of the proposal has a higher

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The other factor is the density associated with returning to 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{s}$
\end_inset

 when starting at 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{*}$
\end_inset

, which has to do with the reversibility of the Markov chain.
 If this is too low, acceptance is not favored.
 We don't want to jump to a new region if we will never get back, as we
 need to sample from the entire support of the posterior.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The two together mean that we will jump to a new area only if we are able
 to eventually jump back with a reasonably high probability.
 The probability of jumping is higher when the new area has a higher posterior
 density, but lower if it's hard to get back.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The idea is to sample from all regions of the posterior, those with high
 and low density, sampling more heavily from regions of high density.
 We want to go occasionally to regions of low density, but it is important
 not to get stuck there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Consider a bimodal density: we want to explore the area around both modes.
 To be able to do that, it is important that the proposal density allows
 us to be able to jump between modes.

\end_inset

because the marginal likelihood 
\begin_inset Formula $f(y)$
\end_inset

 is the same in both cases.
 We don't need to compute that integral! We don't need to know the posterior,
 either.
 The acceptance criterion can be written as: accept if
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{f(y|\theta^{*})}{f(y|\theta^{s})}\frac{\pi(\theta^{*})}{\pi(\theta^{s})}\frac{g(\theta^{s};\theta^{*})}{g(\theta^{*};\theta^{s})}>\alpha

 Play around with the sample size and the tuning parameter, and note the
 effects on the computed posterior mean and on the acceptance rate.
 An example of output is given in Figure

, which shows the final draws of the chain, and the posterior density (computed
 using non-parametric density estimation, more on that later).
 In that Figure, the chain is probably too spiky: too many draws are being
 accepted (it's around 0.6, which you'll see if you run the code), meaning
 that the tuning parameter needs to be increased, to lower the acceptance
 rate.
 If you increase the sample size, you'll see how the posterior concentrates
 around the true value, 3.

if the model is solved using a higher order solution, the Kalman filter
 cannot be used, and Dynare uses particle filtering instead.
 This is very time consuming, as you can check.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Note that you can only use two observed variables for estimation, as there
 are only two shocks in the model.
 This is because of 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

stochastic singularity
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

 of the linearized model.
 When the solution order is higher than 1, there is no reason to limit the
 number of observed variables to be the same as the number of shocks, but
 Dynare still imposes the limit (as of early 2018).
 Some researchers artificially introduce more shocks to a model by assuming
 measurement error.

 Recall that the true value that generated the sample is

 However, the true values of

 The point estimation is working pretty well, but inference still has some

 topic).
 The GRETL manual also has two chapters, which are a nice reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter we'll look at panel data.
 Panel data is an important area in applied econometrics, simply because
 much of the available data has this structure.
 Also, it provides an example where things we've already studied (GLS, endogenei
ty, GMM, Hausman test) come into play.
 There has been much work in this area, and the intention is not to give
 a complete overview, but rather to highlight the issues and see how the
 tools we have studied can be applied.
\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Generalities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Panel data combines cross sectional and time series data: we have a time
 series for each of the agents observed in a cross section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The addition of temporal information to a cross sectional model can in principle
 allow us to investigate issues such as persistence, habit formation, and
 dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Starting from the perspective of a single time series, the addition of cross-sec
tional information allows investigation of heterogeneity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In both cases, if parameters are common across units or over time, the additiona
l data allows for more precise estimation.
 This is simply an example of estimation subject to restrictions, which
 improves efficiency 
\emph on
if the restrictions are correct
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic idea is to allow variables to have two indices, 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,2,...,n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t=1,2,...,T$
\end_inset

.
 The simple linear model
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{i}=\alpha+x_{i}\beta+\epsilon_{i}
\]

\end_inset

 becomes
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{it}=\alpha+x_{it}\beta+\epsilon_{it}
\]

\end_inset

We could think of allowing the parameters to change over time and over cross
 sectional units.
 This would give
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{it}=\alpha_{it}+x_{it}\beta_{it}+\epsilon_{it}
\]

\end_inset

The problem here is that there are more parameters than observations, so
 the model is not identified.
 We need some restraint! The proper restrictions to use of course depend
 on the problem at hand, and a single model is unlikely to be appropriate
 for all situations.
 For example, one could have time and cross-sectional dummies, and slopes
 that vary by time:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{it}=\alpha_{i}+\gamma_{t}+x_{it}\beta_{t}+\epsilon_{it}
\]

\end_inset

There is a lot of room for playing around here.
 We also need to consider whether or not 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 are fixed or growing.
 We'll need at least one of them to be growing in order to do asymptotics.
 
\begin_inset Newpage newpage
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To provide some focus, we'll consider common slope parameters, but agent-specifi
c intercepts, which:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y_{it}=\alpha_{i}+x_{it}\beta+\epsilon_{it}\label{eq:simple linear panel model}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I will refer to this as the 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

simple linear panel model
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This is the model most often encountered in the applied literature.
 It is like the original cross-sectional model, in that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta's$
\end_inset

 are constant over time for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i.$
\end_inset

 However we're now allowing for the constant to vary across 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 (some individual heterogeneity).
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta's$
\end_inset

 are fixed over time, which is a testable restriction, of course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We can consider what happens as 
\begin_inset Formula $n\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is fixed.
 This would be relevant for microeconometric panels, (e.g., the PSID data)
 where a survey of a large number of individuals may be done for a limited
 number of time periods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Macroeconometric applications might look at longer time series for a small
 number of cross-sectional units (e.g., 40 years of quarterly data for 15
 European countries).
 For that case, we could keep 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 fixed (seems appropriate when dealing with the EU countries), and do asymptotic
s as 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 increases, as is normal for time series.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The asymptotic results depend on how we do this, of course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Newpage newpage

\series bold
Why bother using panel data, what are the benefits?
\series default
 The model 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{it}=\alpha_{i}+x_{it}\beta+\epsilon_{it}
\]

\end_inset

 is a restricted version of
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{it}=\alpha_{i}+x_{it}\beta_{i}+\epsilon_{it}
\]

\end_inset

which could be estimated for each 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in turn.
 Why use the panel approach?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Because the restrictions that 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i}=\beta_{j}=...=\beta,$
\end_inset

 if true, lead to more efficient estimation.
 Estimation for each 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in turn will be very uninformative if 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is small.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Another reason is that panel data allows us to estimate parameters that
 are not identified by cross sectional (time series) data.
 For example, if the model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{it}=\alpha_{i}+\gamma_{t}+x_{it}\beta+\epsilon_{it}
\]

\end_inset

and we have only cross sectional data, we cannot estimate the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 If we have only time series data on a single cross sectional unit 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1$
\end_inset

, we cannot estimate the 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Cross-sectional variation allows us to estimate parameters indexed by time,
 and time series variation allows us to estimate parameters indexed by cross-sec
tional unit.
 Parameters indexed by both 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 will require other forms of restrictions in order to be estimable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Another important reason is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 can absorb any missing variables in the regression that don't change over
 time, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{t}$
\end_inset

 can absorb missing variables that don't change across 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 This may help to obtain consistent estimates of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta,$
\end_inset

 if any missing variables are correlated with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{it}.$
\end_inset

The main issues are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
can 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 be estimated consistently? This is almost always a goal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
can the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 be estimated consistently? This is often of secondary interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
sometimes, we're interested in estimating the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 across 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
are the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$

\begin_layout Itemize
does the presence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$

 complicate estimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Static models and correlations between variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To begin with, assume that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{it}$
\end_inset

 are weakly exogenous variables (uncorrelated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{it})$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the model is static: 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{it}$
\end_inset

 does not contain lags of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{it}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
then the basic problem we have in the panel data model 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{it}=\alpha_{i}+x_{it}\beta+\epsilon_{it}$
\end_inset

 is the presence of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 These are individual-specific parameters.
 Or, possibly more accurately, they can be thought of as individual-specific
 variables that are not observed (latent variables).
 The reason for thinking of them as variables is because the agent may choose
 their values following some process, or may choose other variable taking
 these ones as given.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Define 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=E(\alpha_{i})$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $E(\alpha_{i}-\alpha)=0,$
\end_inset

 where the expectation is with respect to the density that describes the
 distribution of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 in the population.
 Our model 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{it}=\alpha_{i}+x_{it}\beta+\epsilon_{it}$
\end_inset

 may be written 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
y_{it} & =\alpha_{i}+x_{it}\beta+\epsilon_{it}\\
 & =\alpha+x_{it}\beta+(\alpha_{i}-\alpha+\epsilon_{it})\\
 & =\alpha+x_{it}\beta+\eta_{it}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $E(\eta_{it})=0.$
\end_inset

 A way of thinking about the data generating process is this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
First, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 is drawn, from the population density
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
then 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{it}$
\end_inset

 are drawn from 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{X}(z|\alpha_{i}).$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the important point is that the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
may vary depending on the realization of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For example, if 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 is the quantity demanded of a luxury good, then a high value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 means that agent 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 will buy a large quantity, on average.
 This may be possible only when the agent's income is also high.
 Thus, it may be possible to draw high values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 only when income is also high, otherwise, the budget constraint would be
 violated.
 If income is one of the variables in 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{it},$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{it}$
\end_inset

 are not independent.
\begin_inset Separator latexpar
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Another example: consider returns to education, modeling wage as a function
 of education.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 could be an individual specific measure of ability.
 Ability could affect wages, but it could also affect the number of years
 of education.
 When education is a regressor and ability is a component of the error,
 we may expect an endogeneity problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Thus, there may be correlation between 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{it}$
\end_inset

, in which case 
\begin_inset Formula $E(x_{it}\eta_{it})\ne$
\end_inset

0 in the above equation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
This means that OLS estimation of the model would lead to biased and inconsisten
t estimates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
However, it is possible (but unlikely for economic data) that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{it}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{it}$
\end_inset

 are independent or at least uncorrelated, if the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{it}$
\end_inset

 is constant with respect to the realization of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 In this case OLS estimation would be consistent.

The transformed model is

Estimation with random effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original model is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{it}=\alpha_{i}+x_{it}\beta+\epsilon_{it}
\]

\end_inset

This can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
y_{it} & = & \alpha+x_{it}\beta+\left(\alpha_{i}-\alpha+\epsilon_{it}\right)\nonumber \\
y_{it} & = & \alpha+x_{it}\beta+\eta_{it}\label{eq:simple linear panel random effects}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Under random effects, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 are assumed not to be correlated with the 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{it},$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $E(\eta_{it})=0,$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E(x_{it}\eta_{it})=0$
\end_inset

.
 As such, the OLS estimator of this model is consistent.
 We can recover estimates of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 as discussed above.
 It is to be noted that the error 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{it}$
\end_inset

 is almost certainly heteroscedastic and autocorrelated, so OLS will not
 be efficient, and inferences based on OLS need to be done taking this into
 account.
 One could attempt to use GLS, or panel-robust covariance matrix estimation,
 or both, as above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are other estimators when we have random effects, a well-known example
 being the 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

between
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

 estimator, which operates on the time averages of the cross sectional units.
 There is no advantage to doing this, as the overall estimator is already
 consistent, and averaging looses information (efficiency loss).
 One would still need to deal with cross sectional heteroscedasticity when
 using the between estimator, so there is no gain in simplicity, either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is to be emphasized that 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

random effects
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

 is not a plausible assumption with most economic data, so use of this estimator
 is discouraged, even if your statistical package offers it as an option.

Now, what happens if the test does not reject? One could optimistically

 Failure to reject does not mean that the null hypothesis is true.
 After all, estimation of the covariance matrices needed to compute the
 Hausman test is a non-trivial issue, and is a source of considerable noise
 in the test statistic (noise=low power).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Finally, the simple version of the Hausman test requires that the estimator
 under the null be fully efficient.
 Achieving this goal is probably a utopian prospect.
 A conservative approach would acknowledge that neither estimator is likely
 to be efficient, and to operate accordingly.

Dynamic panel data

\begin_layout Standard
When we have panel data, we have information on both 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{it}$
\end_inset

 as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i,t-1}$
\end_inset

.
 One may naturally think of including 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i,t-1}$
\end_inset

 as a regressor, to capture dynamic effects that can't be analyed with only
 cross-sectional data.
 Excluding dynamic effects is often the reason for detection of spurious
 AUT of the errors.
 With dynamics, there is likely to be less of a problem of autocorrelation,
 but one should still be concerned that some might still be present.
 The model, using a single lag of the dependent variable, becomes
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{it} & = & \alpha_{i}+\gamma y_{i,t-1}+x_{it}\beta+\epsilon_{it}\\
y_{it} & = & \alpha+\gamma y_{i,t-1}+x_{it}\beta+\left(\alpha_{i}-\alpha+\epsilon_{it}\right)\\
y_{it} & = & \alpha+\gamma y_{i,t-1}+x_{it}\beta+\eta_{it}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

We assume that the 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{it}$
\end_inset

 are uncorrelated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{it}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a component that determines both 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{it}$
\end_inset

 and its lag, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i,t-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i,t-1}$
\end_inset

 are correlated, even if the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 are pure random effects (uncorrelated with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{it}$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i,t-1}$
\end_inset

 is correlated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{it}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For this reason, OLS estimation is inconsistent even for the random effects
 model, and it's also of course still inconsistent for the fixed effects
 model.

 Getting rid of the

 We could subtract the time averages, as above for the

 instruments.
 Instead, consider the model in first differences
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{it}-y_{i,t-1} & = & \left(\alpha_{i}+\gamma y_{i,t-1}+x_{it}\beta+\epsilon_{it}\right)-\left(\alpha_{i}+\gamma y_{i,t-2}+x_{i,t-1}\beta+\epsilon_{i,t-1}\right)\\
 & = & \gamma\left(y_{i,t-1}-y_{i,t-2}\right)+\left(x_{it}-x_{i,t-1}\right)\beta+\epsilon_{it}-\epsilon_{i,t-1}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Itemize

 Serial correlation of the errors

 additional lags of the dependent variable.
 However, too many lags leads to a reduction of the sample size, so there's
 a limit to what can be done without having variances explode.

nonparametric inference

 The conditional mean is the function

Suppose that the problem of interest is to estimate the elasticity of 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $x,$
\end_inset

 throughout the range of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 Recall that the elasticity is an elasticity is the marginal function divided

In general, the functional form of 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 is unknown.
 One idea is to take a Taylor's series approximation to 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 about some point 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}.$
\end_inset

 Flexible functional forms such as the transcendental logarithmic (usually
 known as the translog) can be interpreted as second order Taylor's series
 approximations.
 We'll work with a first order approximation, for simplicity.
 Approximating about 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h(x)=f(x_{0})+D_{x}f(x_{0})\left(x-x_{0}\right)
\]

\end_inset

 If the approximation point is 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}=0,$
\end_inset

 we can write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h(x)=a+bx
\]

\end_inset

 The coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is the value of the function at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0,$
\end_inset

 and the slope is the value of the derivative at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0.$
\end_inset

 These are of course not known.
 One might try estimation by ordinary least squares.
 The objective function is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s(a,b)=1/n\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left(y_{t}-h(x_{t})\right)^{2}.
\]

\begin_inset Formula 
\[

 The theorem regarding the consistency of extremum estimators (Theorem

Now suppose we use the leading terms of a trigonometric series as the approximat
ing model.
 The reason for using a trigonometric series as an approximating model is
 motivated by the asymptotic properties of the Fourier flexible functional
 form (Gallant, 1981, 1982), which is an example of a 
\emph on
sieve estimator
\emph default
.
 Normally with this type of model the number of basis functions is an increasing
 function of the sample size.
 Here we hold the set of basis function fixed.
 We will consider the asymptotic behavior of a fixed model, which we interpret
 as an approximation to the estimator's behavior in finite samples.
 Consider the set of basis functions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z(x)=\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}
1 & x & \cos(x) & \sin(x) & \cos(2x) & \sin(2x)\end{array}\right].
\]

\end_inset

 The approximating model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g_{K}(x)=Z(x)\alpha.
\]

\end_inset

 Maintaining these basis functions as the sample size increases, we find
 that the limiting objective function is minimized at 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\{ a_{1}=\frac{7}{6},a_{2}=\frac{1}{\pi},a_{3}=-\frac{1}{\pi^{2}},a_{4}=0,a_{5}=-\frac{1}{4\pi^{2}},a_{6}=0\right\} .
\]

\end_inset

 Substituting these values into 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{K}(x)$
\end_inset

 we obtain the almost sure limit of the approximation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
g_{\infty}(x)=7/6+x/\pi+\left(\cos x\right)\left(-\frac{1}{\pi^{2}}\right)+\left(\sin x\right)0+\left(\cos2x\right)\left(-\frac{1}{4\pi^{2}}\right)+\left(\sin2x\right)0\label{g}

To show pointwise consistency of

\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x),$
\end_inset

 first consider the expectation of the estimator (because the estimator

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left[\hat{h}(x)\right]=\int\gamma_{n}^{-k}K\left[\left(x-z\right)/\gamma_{n}\right]h(z)dz.

 Change variables as

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $z=x-\gamma_{n}z^{*}$

 & = & \int K\left(z^{*}\right)h(x-\gamma_{n}z^{*})dz^{*}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 Now, asymptotically, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}E\left[\hat{h}(x)\right] & = & \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int K\left(z^{*}\right)h(x-\gamma_{n}z^{*})dz^{*}\\

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
n\gamma_{n}^{k}V\left[\hat{h}(x)\right] & = & n\gamma_{n}^{k}\frac{1}{n^{2}}\sum_{t=1}^{n}V\left\{ \frac{K\left[\left(x-x_{t}\right)/\gamma_{n}\right]}{\gamma_{n}^{k}}\right\} \\
 & = & \gamma_{n}^{-k}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}V\left\{ K\left[\left(x-x_{t}\right)/\gamma_{n}\right]\right\} 
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Itemize
By the representative term argument, this is
\begin_inset Separator latexpar
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n\gamma_{n}^{k}V\left[\hat{h}(x)\right]=\gamma_{n}^{-k}V\left\{ K\left[\left(x-z\right)/\gamma_{n}\right]\right\} 
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Also, since 
\begin_inset Formula $V(x)=E(x^{2})-E(x)^{2}$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
n\gamma_{n}^{k}V\left[\hat{h}(x)\right] & = & \gamma_{n}^{-k}E\left\{ \left(K\left[\left(x-z\right)/\gamma_{n}\right]\right)^{2}\right\} -\gamma_{n}^{-k}\left\{ E\left(K\left[\left(x-z\right)/\gamma_{n}\right]\right)\right\} ^{2}\\
 & = & \int\gamma_{n}^{-k}K\left[\left(x-z\right)/\gamma_{n}\right]^{2}h(z)dz-\gamma_{n}^{k}\left\{ \int\gamma_{n}^{-k}K\left[\left(x-z\right)/\gamma_{n}\right]h(z)dz\right\} ^{2}\\
 & = & \int\gamma_{n}^{-k}K\left[\left(x-z\right)/\gamma_{n}\right]^{2}h(z)dz-\gamma_{n}^{k}E\left[\widehat{h}(x)\right]^{2}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 The second term converges to zero: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma_{n}^{k}E\left[\widehat{h}(x)\right]^{2}\rightarrow0,
\]

\end_inset

 by the previous result regarding the expectation and the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{n}\rightarrow0.$
\end_inset

 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}n\gamma_{n}^{k}V\left[\hat{h}(x)\right]=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int\gamma_{n}^{-k}K\left[\left(x-z\right)/\gamma_{n}\right]^{2}h(z)dz.
\]

\end_inset

 Using exactly the same change of variables as before, this can be shown
 to be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}n\gamma_{n}^{k}V\left[\hat{h}(x)\right]=h(x)\int\left[K(z^{*})\right]^{2}dz^{*}.
\]

\end_inset

 Since both 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[K(z^{*})\right]^{2}dz^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x)$
\end_inset

 are bounded, the RHS is bounded, and since 
\begin_inset Formula $n\gamma_{n}^{k}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 by assumption, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V\left[\hat{h}(x)\right]\rightarrow0.
\]

\end_inset

Estimation of the numerator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\int yf(x,y)dy,$
\end_inset

 we need an estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,y).$
\end_inset

 The estimator has the same form as the estimator for 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x),$
\end_inset

 only with one dimension more: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{f}(x,y)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{K_{*}\left[\left(y-y_{t}\right)/\gamma_{n},\left(x-x_{t}\right)/\gamma_{n}\right]}{\gamma_{n}^{k+1}}
\]

\end_inset

 The kernel 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{*}\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 is required to have mean zero: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int yK_{*}\left(y,x\right)dy=0
\]

\end_inset

 and to marginalize to the previous kernel for 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x):$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int K_{*}\left(y,x\right)dy=K(x).
\]

\end_inset

 With this kernel, we have (not obviously, see Li and Racine, Ch.
 2, section 2.1) 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int y\hat{f}(y,x)dy=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}y_{t}\frac{K\left[\left(x-x_{t}\right)/\gamma_{n}\right]}{\gamma_{n}^{k}}
\]

\end_inset

 by marginalization of the kernel, so we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{g}(x) & := & \frac{1}{\hat{h}(x)}\int y\hat{f}(y,x)dy\\
 & = & \frac{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}y_{t}\frac{K\left[\left(x-x_{t}\right)/\gamma_{n}\right]}{\gamma_{n}^{k}}}{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{K\left[\left(x-x_{t}\right)/\gamma_{n}\right]}{\gamma_{n}^{k}}}\\
 & = & \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n}y_{t}K\left[\left(x-x_{t}\right)/\gamma_{n}\right]}{\sum_{t=1}^{n}K\left[\left(x-x_{t}\right)/\gamma_{n}\right]}

Cross-validation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The selection of an appropriate window width is important.
 One popular method is cross validation.
 This consists of splitting the sample into two parts (e.g., 50%-50%).
 The first part is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in sample
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 data, which is used for estimation, and the second part is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

out of sample
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 data, used for evaluation of the fit though RMSE or some other criterion.
 The steps are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Split the data.
 The out of sample data is 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{out}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{out}$

 (these are the first 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{out}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
With the in sample data, fit 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{y}_{t}^{out}(\gamma)$
\end_inset

 corresponding to each 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}^{out}.$
\end_inset

 This fitted value is a function of the window width, the in sample data,
 as well as the evaluation point 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}^{out}$
\end_inset

, but it does not involve 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}^{out}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\begin_layout Enumerate
Go to step

\end_inset

 or to the next step if enough window widths have been tried.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Select the 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\gamma)$
\end_inset

 a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma).$

 observation.
 This is the recommended procedure.
 It is somewhat more demanding computationally, but works better.

\begin_layout Subsection
Kernel density estimation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The previous discussion suggests that a kernel density estimator may easily
 be constructed.
 We have already seen how joint densities may be estimated.
 If were interested in a conditional density, for example of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 conditional on 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, then the kernel estimate of the conditional density is simply
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{f}_{y|x} & = & \frac{\hat{f}(x,y)}{\hat{h}(x)}\\
 & = & \frac{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{K_{*}\left[\left(y-y_{t}\right)/\gamma_{n},\left(x-x_{t}\right)/\gamma_{n}\right]}{\gamma_{n}^{k+1}}}{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{K\left[\left(x-x_{t}\right)/\gamma_{n}\right]}{\gamma_{n}^{k}}}\\
 & = & \frac{1}{\gamma_{n}}\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n}K_{*}\left[\left(y-y_{t}\right)/\gamma_{n},\left(x-x_{t}\right)/\gamma_{n}\right]}{\sum_{t=1}^{n}K\left[\left(x-x_{t}\right)/\gamma_{n}\right]}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where we obtain the expressions for the joint and marginal densities from
 the section on kernel regression.

 We see that they're pretty close, when the sample size is large enough
 for the kernel estimate to be precise.
 Try playing around with a smaller sample, and see what happens.

\begin_layout Standard
MLE is the estimation method of choice when we are confident about specifying
 the density.
 Is is possible to obtain the benefits of MLE when we're not so confident
 about the specification? In part, yes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose we're interested in the density of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 conditional on 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 (both may be vectors).
 Suppose that the density 
\begin_inset Formula $f(y|x,\phi)$
\end_inset

 is a reasonable starting approximation to the true density.
 This density can be reshaped by multiplying it by a squared polynomial.
 The new density is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g_{p}(y|x,\phi,\gamma)=\frac{h_{p}^{2}(y|\gamma)f(y|x,\phi)}{\eta_{p}(x,\phi,\gamma)}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{p}(y|\gamma)=\sum_{k=0}^{p}\gamma_{k}y^{k}
\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{p}(x,\phi,\gamma)$
\end_inset

 is a normalizing factor to make the density integrate (sum) to one.
 Because 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{p}^{2}(y|\gamma)/\eta_{p}(x,\phi,\gamma)$
\end_inset

 is a homogenous function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 it is necessary to impose a normalization to identify the parameters: 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{0}$
\end_inset

 is set to 1.
 The normalization factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{p}(\phi,\gamma)$
\end_inset

 is calculated (following Cameron and Johansson) using
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
E(Y^{r}) & = & \sum_{y=0}^{\infty}y^{r}f_{Y}(y|\phi,\gamma)\\
 & = & \sum_{y=0}^{\infty}y^{r}\frac{\left[h_{p}\left(y|\gamma\right)\right]^{2}}{\eta_{p}(\phi,\gamma)}f_{Y}(y|\phi)\\
 & = & \sum_{y=0}^{\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{p}\sum_{l=0}^{p}y^{r}f_{Y}(y|\phi)\gamma_{k}\gamma_{l}y^{k}y^{l}/\eta_{p}(\phi,\gamma)\\
 & = & \sum_{k=0}^{p}\sum_{l=0}^{p}\gamma_{k}\gamma_{l}\left\{ \sum_{y=0}^{\infty}y^{r+k+l}f_{Y}(y|\phi)\right\} /\eta_{p}(\phi,\gamma)\\
 & = & \sum_{k=0}^{p}\sum_{l=0}^{p}\gamma_{k}\gamma_{l}m_{k+l+r}/\eta_{p}(\phi,\gamma).
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

By setting 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0$
\end_inset

 we get that the normalizing factor is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "normfactor"

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\eta_{p}(\phi,\gamma)=\sum_{k=0}^{p}\sum_{l=0}^{p}\gamma_{k}\gamma_{l}m_{k+l}\label{normfactor}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{0}$
\end_inset

 is set to 1 to achieve identification.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{r}$
\end_inset

 in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "normfactor"

\end_inset

 are the raw moments of the baseline density.
 Gallant and Nychka (1987) give conditions under which such a density may
 be treated as correctly specified, asymptotically.
 Basically, the order of the polynomial must increase as the sample size
 increases.
 However, there are technicalities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly to Cameron and Johannson (1997), we may develop a negative binomial
 polynomial (NBP) density for count data.
 The negative binomial baseline density may be written (see equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:negbindensity"

\end_inset

) as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{Y}(y|\phi)=\frac{\Gamma(y+\psi)}{\Gamma(y+1)\Gamma(\psi)}\left(\frac{\psi}{\psi+\lambda}\right)^{\psi}\left(\frac{\lambda}{\psi+\lambda}\right)^{y}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\{\lambda,\psi\},$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi>0$
\end_inset

.
 The usual means of incorporating conditioning variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is the parameterization 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=e^{\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=\lambda/\alpha$
\end_inset

 we have the negative binomial-I model (NB-I).
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=1/\alpha$
\end_inset

 we have the negative binomial-II (NP-II) model.
 For the NB-I density, 
\begin_inset Formula $V(Y)=\lambda+\alpha\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 In the case of the NB-II model, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $V(Y)=\lambda+\alpha\lambda^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 For both forms, 
\begin_inset Formula $E(Y)=\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reshaped density, with normalization to sum to one, is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f_{Y}(y|\phi,\gamma)=\frac{\left[h_{p}\left(y|\gamma\right)\right]^{2}}{\eta_{p}(\phi,\gamma)}\frac{\Gamma(y+\psi)}{\Gamma(y+1)\Gamma(\psi)}\left(\frac{\psi}{\psi+\lambda}\right)^{\psi}\left(\frac{\lambda}{\psi+\lambda}\right)^{y}.\label{NBP}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

To get the normalization factor, we need the moment generating function:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
M_{Y}(t)=\psi^{\psi}\left(\lambda-e^{t}\lambda+\psi\right)^{-\psi}.\label{nbmgf}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

To illustrate, Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 shows calculation of the first four raw moments of the NB density, calculated

 These are the moments you would need to use a second order polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $(p=2)$

It is possible that there is conditional heterogeneity such that the appropriate
 reshaping should be more local.
 This can be accomodated by allowing the 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{k}$
\end_inset

 parameters to depend upon the conditioning variables, for example using
 polynomials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gallant and Nychka, 
\emph on
Econometrica
\emph default
, 1987 prove that this sort of density can approximate a wide variety of
 densities arbitrarily well as the degree of the polynomial increases with
 the sample size.
 This approach is not without its drawbacks: the sample objective function
 can have an 
\emph on
extremely
\emph default
 large number of local maxima that can lead to numeric difficulties.
 If someone could figure out how to do in a way such that the sample objective
 function was nice and smooth, they would probably get the paper published
 in a good journal.
 Any ideas?

Note that for income, there is a U shape.
 Previously, we found that income appeared to be insignificant (run EstimatePois
son to see it again).
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Perhaps that insignificance was due to omitting a nonlinear effect (e.g.,
 quadratic).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The U shape could also be due to ignoring endogeneity of income.
 If a person is seriously ill, they may make more doctor visits, but may
 also suffer loss of income due to reduces work hours.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Another explanation might be that kernel regression has a high variance
 in regions of data sparseness, so that for very low or high incomes, an
 outlier or two can have a big impact

Many structural economic models often cannot generate data that exhibits
 conditional heteroscedasticity without directly assuming shocks that are
 conditionally heteroscedastic.
 It would be nice to have an economic explanation for how conditional heterosced
asticity, leptokurtosis, and other (leverage, etc.) features of financial
 data result from the behavior of economic agents, rather than from a black

\begin_layout Section
Fully nonparametric conditional quantiles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To compute conditional quantiles for the classical linear model, we used
 the assumption of normality.
 Can we estimate conditional quantiles without making distributional assumptions
? Yes, we can! (nod to Obama) (a note from 2018: those were the good old
 days!).
 You can do fully nonparametric conditional density estimation, as in Chapter
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Nonparametric-inference"

\end_inset

, and use the fitted conditional density to compute quantiles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Note that estimating quantiles where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is close to 0 or 1 is difficult, because you have few observations that
 lie in the neighborhood of the quantile, so you should expect a large variance
 if you go the nonparametric route.
 For more central quantiles, like the median, this will be less of a problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For this reason, we may go the 
\emph on
semi-parametric
\emph default
 route, which imposes more structure.
 When people talk about quantile regression, they usually mean the semi-parametr
ic approach.

Quantile regression as a semi-parametric estimator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most widely used method does not take either of the extreme positions,
 it is not fully parametric, like the linear regression model with known
 distribution of errors, but some parametric restrictions are made, to improve
 efficiency compared to the fully nonparametric approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The assumption is that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

-conditional quantile of the dependent variable 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is a linear function of the conditioning variables 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{\alpha|X=x}=x^{\prime}\beta_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

The question is how to estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 when we don't make distributional assumptions.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It turns out that the problem can be expressed as an extremum estimator:
 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\beta_{\alpha}}=\arg\min s_{n}(\beta)$
\end_inset

 where
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{n}(\beta)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left[1(y_{i}\geq x_{i}^{\prime}\beta_{\alpha})\alpha+1(y_{i}<x_{i}^{\prime}\beta_{\alpha})(1-\alpha)\right]\left|y_{i}-x_{i}^{\prime}\beta_{\alpha}\right|
\]

\end_inset

First, suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=0.5,$
\end_inset

 so we are estimating the median.
 Then the objective simplifies to minimizing the absolute deviations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{n}(\beta)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left|y_{i}-x_{i}^{\prime}\beta_{\alpha}\right|
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The presence of the weights in the general version accounts for the fact
 that if we're estimating the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=0.1$
\end_inset

 quantile, we expect 90% of the 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

 to be greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}^{\prime}\beta_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

, and only 10% to be smaller.
 We need to down-weight the likely events and up-weight the unlikely events
 so that the objective function minimizes at the appropriate place.

 presents an analysis of returns to schooling using the data from the National
 Longitudinal Survey of Young Men, for those interviewed in 1976.
 Card presents OLS and instrumental variables estimates for a number of
 specifications, using college proximity as an instrument for years of education
, and age as an instrument for experience.
 Here, we work with the simple model from column (1) of Card's Table 2.
 Let's consider estimation of conditional quantiles for the model.
 The model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
Q_{\ln W|X}(\tau) & =\beta_{0}(\tau)+\beta_{EDUC}(\tau)EDUC+\beta_{X}(\tau)EXP+\beta_{EXP^{2}}(\tau)\frac{EXP^{2}}{100}\\
 & +\beta_{BLACK}(\tau)BLACK+\beta_{SMSA}(\tau)SMSA+\beta_{SOUTH}(\tau)SOUTH\\
 & \equiv X\beta(\tau)
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the dependent variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln W$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the regressors are years of education (EDUC), experience (EXP), experience
 squared divided by 100, a black indicator (BLACK), a metropolitan area
 indicator (SMSA), and a South indicator (SOUTH).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We explore estimation of quantiles treating all variables as exogenous,
 or treating education and experience as endogenous, and the others as exogenous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When education and experience are treated as endogenous, we use proximity
 to an accredited four year college (NEARC4) as an instrumental variable.
 EXPER is defined as EXPER = AGE-EDUC-6, so if EDUC is endogenous, so is
 EXPER.
 We use AGE as an instrument for EXPER.

the use of moment conditions is a dimension reducing operation: the full
 sample likelihood requires knowing the distribution of

 conditions and their asymptotic distribution only requires knowing the
 (asymptotic) distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$

 The basic proposal draws the parameter from independent normal densities.
 The second proposal draws the parameters from a joint normal density that
 accounts for correlations in the posterior.
 The empirical results reported below don't depend on which proposal is
 used, though, as a long enough chain was used so that the difference washes
 out.
 This is an issue of computational efficiency, not one of statistical reliabilit
y.
 To obtain reliable results with a shorter chain, the proposal density should
 be chosen to ensure good mixing (sampling from the whole support of the
 posterior).

The effect of education, according to the IVQR results, is substantially
 larger, for all quantiles, with an additional year of education increasing
 all quantiles, except the 40th, by more than 20%.
 This is good news for the people in the U.S.
 that have to take out enormous student loans.
 Given the cost of college tuition in the U.S., the miserable 7% return that
 OLS and ordinary QR find would probably not be enough to induce people
 to take out loans.
 So, we have external reasons to believe that this higher number may be
 more realistic.
 It would be interesting to study the evolution of returns over time, and
 compare them to the cost of education.

Multinomial discrete choice is illustrated by a (very simple) job search

 The utility of alternative

 Utilities of jobs, stacked in the vector

Marginalization of latent variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Economic data often presents substantial heterogeneity that may be difficult
 to model.
 A possibility is to introduce latent random variables.
 This can cause the problem that there may be no known closed form for the
 distribution of observable variables after marginalizing out the unobservable
 latent variables.
 For example, count data (that takes values 
\begin_inset Formula $0,1,2,3,...)$
\end_inset

 is often modeled using the Poisson distribution 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Pr(Y=y_{i})=\frac{\exp(-\lambda)\lambda^{i}}{y_{i}!}
\]

\end_inset

 The mean and variance of the Poisson distribution are both equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda:$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{E}(y)=V(y)=\lambda.
\]

\end_inset

 Often, one parameterizes the conditional mean as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda_{i}=\exp(X_{i}\beta).
\]

\end_inset

 This ensures that the mean is positive (as it must be).
 Estimation by ML is straightforward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Often, count data exhibits 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

overdispersion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which simply means that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V(y)>\mathcal{E}(y).
\]

\end_inset

 If this is the case, a solution is to use the negative binomial distribution
 rather than the Poisson.
 An alternative is to introduce a latent variable that reflects heterogeneity
 into the specification: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda_{i}=\exp(X_{i}\beta+\eta_{i})
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{i}$
\end_inset

 has some specified density with support 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 (this density may depend on additional parameters).
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $d\mu(\eta_{i})$
\end_inset

 be the density of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{i}.$
\end_inset

 The marginal density of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Pr(Y=y_{i}|X_{i})=\int_{S}\frac{\exp\left[-\exp(X_{i}\beta+\eta_{i})\right]\left[\exp(X_{i}\beta+\eta_{i})\right]^{y_{i}}}{y_{i}!}d\mu(\eta_{i})
\]

\end_inset

 A realistic model should account for exogenous shocks to the system, which
 can be done by assuming a random component.
 This leads to a model that is expressed as a system of stochastic differential
 equations.
 Consider the process

I have changed the parameter from

 As such

ML
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 estimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

 is actually quasi-maximum likelihood estimation.
 When actual data is available on a daily, say, basis, then you could set
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=1,$
\end_inset

 and use the discretized model to do QML estimation.
 However, the time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 may be too large to give an accurate approximation to the model, and if
 this is the case, the QML estimator could suffer from a large bias for
 estimation of the original parameter, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Nevertheless, the approximation shouldn't be too bad, especially if 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$

 is small.
 For example, one could simulate the model at a frequency of 1 minute, saving
 every 1440th point on the path (60
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

24 = 1440), which would give a good approximation of the evolution of the
 daily observations.
 The

 Simulation-based inference allows for direct inference on

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The important point about these three examples is that computational difficultie

 Nevertheless the model is fully specified in probabilistic terms up to

 To use the multinomial probit model as an example, the log-likelihood function

\begin_inset Formula

 in spite of the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula

 Therefore the SLLN applies to cancel out simulation errors, from which
 we get consistency.
 That is, using simple notation for the random sampling case, the moment
 conditions

\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde{m}(\theta) & = & \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left[K(y_{t},x_{t})-\frac{1}{H}\sum_{h=1}^{H}k(\widetilde{y}_{t}^{h},x_{t})\right]z_{t}\\
 & = & \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left[k(x_{t},\theta^{0})+\varepsilon_{t}-\frac{1}{H}\sum_{h=1}^{H}\left[k(x_{t},\theta)+\tilde{\varepsilon}_{ht}\right]\right]z_{t}\label{simulated moments}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

 converge almost surely to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{m}_{\infty}(\theta)=\int\left[k(x,\theta^{0})-k(x,\theta)\right]z(x)d\mu(x).

 estimates the same model using the same data set and the same auxiliary
 statistics, but using MCMC, so we get a full posterior for each parameter,
 instead of just a point estimate.
 The likelihood is the asymptotic Gaussian likelihood of the auxiliary statistic
s.
 This lets us use Bayesian methods even if the small sample distribution
 of the statistics is unknown.
 This is a little time consuming, with simulation used to get the likelihood,
 and then the MCMC steps.
 However, the results are quite good, as we see in Figure

 The first order moving average (MA(1)) model has been widely used to investigat
e the performance of the indirect inference estimator, and a 
\begin_inset Formula $pth$
\end_inset

-order autoregressive model is often used to generate the auxiliary statistic
 (see, for example, Gouriéroux
\emph on
, 
\emph default
Monfort and Renault, 1993; Chumacero, 2001).
 In this section we estimate the MA(1) model
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{t} & = & \epsilon_{t}+\psi\epsilon_{t-1}\\
\epsilon_{t} & \sim & i.i.d.\,N(0,\sigma^{2})
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

The parameter vector is 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=(\psi,\sigma).$
\end_inset

 We set the parameter space for the initial simulated annealing stage (to
 get good start values for the gradient-based algorithm) to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta=\left(-1,1\right)\times\left(0,2\right)$
\end_inset

, which imposes invertibility, which is needed for the parameter to be identifie
d.
 The statistic 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the vector of estimated parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\rho_{0},\rho_{1},...,\rho_{P},\sigma_{\upsilon}^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 of an AR(
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

) model 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}=\rho_{0}+\sum_{p=1}^{P}\rho_{p}y_{t-p}+\upsilon_{t}$

We estimate

 using MSM implemented as II, using continuously updated GMM (Hanson, Heaton

 The moment conditions that define the continuously updated indirect inference

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{Z}_{S,n}(\theta)=\frac{1}{S}\sum_{s=1}^{S}Z_{n}^{s}(\theta)$

\begin_layout Standard
We have seen (see equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:negbindensity"

\end_inset

) that a Poisson model with latent heterogeneity that follows an exponential
 distribution leads to the negative binomial model.
 To illustrate SML, we can integrate out the latent heterogeneity using
 Monte Carlo, rather than the analytical approach which leads to the negative
 binomial model.
 In actual practice, one would not want to use SML in this case, but it
 is a nice example since it allows us to compare SML to the actual ML estimator.

 Note that simulated annealing is used to maximize the log likelihood function.
 Attempting to use BFGS leads to trouble.
 If you run this script, you will see that it takes a long time to get the
 estimation results, which are:

If you compare these results to the results for the negative binomial model,
 given in subsection (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Infinite-mixture-models:"

\end_inset

), you can see that the present model fits better according to the CAIC
 criterion.
 It also fits better than the seminonparametric negative binomial model,
 presented in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Semi-nonparametric-maximum-likel"

\end_inset

, which has more parameters.
 The present model is considerably less convenient to work with, however,
 due to the computational requirements.

 of this sort.

Simple laws of large numbers (LLN's) allow us to directly conclude that

 in the OLS example, since 
\begin_inset Formula

\hat{\beta}_{n}=\beta^{0}+\left(\frac{X^{\prime}X}{n}\right)^{-1}\left(\frac{X^{\prime}\varepsilon}{n}\right),

 Note that this term is not a function of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta.$

 This easy proof is a result of the linearity of the model, which allows
 us to express the estimator in a way that separates parameters from random
 functions.
 In general, this is not possible.
 We often deal with the more complicated situation where the stochastic
 sequence depends on parameters in a manner that is not reducible to a simple

I will present the theory for 
\begin_inset Formula $H$

 finite, and possibly small.
 This is done because it is sometimes impractical to estimate with 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 very large.
 Gallant and Tauchen give the theory for the case of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 so large that it may be treated as infinite (the difference being irrelevant
 given the numerical precision of a computer).
 The theory for the case of

\end_inset

 infinite follows directly from the results presented here.

\begin_layout Standard
The moment condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\widetilde{m}(\theta,\hat{\lambda})$
\end_inset

 depends on the pseudo-ML estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\lambda}.$
\end_inset

 We can apply Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Normality of ee"

\end_inset

 to conclude that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\lambda}-\lambda^{0}\right)\stackrel{d}{\rightarrow}N\left[0,\mathcal{J}(\lambda^{0})^{-1}\mathcal{I}(\lambda^{0})\mathcal{J}(\lambda^{0})^{-1}\right]\label{lamdist}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 If the density 
\begin_inset Formula $f(y_{t}|x_{t},\hat{\lambda})$
\end_inset

 were in fact the true density 
\begin_inset Formula $p(y|x_{t},\theta),$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 would be the maximum likelihood estimator, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{J}(\lambda^{0})^{-1}\mathcal{I}(\lambda^{0})$
\end_inset

 would be an identity matrix, due to the information matrix equality.
 However, in the present case we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(y_{t}|x_{t},\hat{\lambda})$
\end_inset

 is only an approximation to 
\begin_inset Formula $p(y|x_{t},\theta),$
\end_inset

 so there is no cancellation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{J}(\lambda^{0})\equiv p\lim\left(\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\lambda\partial\lambda^{\prime}}s_{n}(\lambda^{0})\right).$
\end_inset

 Comparing the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}(\lambda)$
\end_inset

 with the definition of the moment condition in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, we see that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{J}(\lambda^{0})=D_{\lambda^{\prime}}m(\theta^{0},\lambda^{0}).
\]

\end_inset

 As in Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "Normality of ee"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{I}(\lambda^{0})=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\mathcal{E}\left[n\left.\frac{\partial s_{n}(\lambda)}{\partial\lambda}\right|_{\lambda^{0}}\left.\frac{\partial s_{n}(\lambda)}{\partial\lambda^{\prime}}\right|_{\lambda^{0}}\right].
\]

\end_inset

 In this case, this is simply the asymptotic variance covariance matrix
 of the moment conditions, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega.$
\end_inset

 Now take a first order Taylor's series approximation to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}\bar{m}_{n}(\theta^{0},\hat{\lambda})$
\end_inset

 about 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{0}$
\end_inset

 :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}\tilde{m}_{n}(\theta^{0},\hat{\lambda})=\sqrt{n}\tilde{m}_{n}(\theta^{0},\lambda^{0})+\sqrt{n}D_{\lambda^{\prime}}\tilde{m}(\theta^{0},\lambda^{0})\left(\hat{\lambda}-\lambda^{0}\right)+o_{p}(1)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}\tilde{m}_{n}(\theta^{0},\lambda^{0})$
\end_inset

.
 It is straightforward but somewhat tedious to show that the asymptotic
 variance of this term is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{H}I_{\infty}(\lambda^{0})$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next consider the second term 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}D_{\lambda^{\prime}}\tilde{m}(\theta^{0},\lambda^{0})\left(\hat{\lambda}-\lambda^{0}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\lambda^{\prime}}\tilde{m}_{n}(\theta^{0},\lambda^{0})\stackrel{a.s.}{\rightarrow}\mathcal{J}(\lambda^{0}),$
\end_inset

 so we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}D_{\lambda^{\prime}}\tilde{m}(\theta^{0},\lambda^{0})\left(\hat{\lambda}-\lambda^{0}\right)=\sqrt{n}\mathcal{J}(\lambda^{0})\left(\hat{\lambda}-\lambda^{0}\right),a.s.
\]

\end_inset

 But noting equation

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}\mathcal{J}(\lambda^{0})\left(\hat{\lambda}-\lambda^{0}\right)\stackrel{a}{\sim}N\left[0,\mathcal{I}(\lambda^{0})\right]
\]

\end_inset

Now, combining the results for the first and second terms, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}\tilde{m}_{n}(\theta^{0},\hat{\lambda})\stackrel{a}{\sim}N\left[0,\left(1+\frac{1}{H}\right)\mathcal{I}(\lambda^{0})\right]
\]

\end_inset

 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\mathcal{I}(\lambda^{0})}$
\end_inset

 is a consistent estimator of the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix
 of the moment conditions.
 This may be complicated if the score generator is a poor approximator,
 since the individual score contributions may not have mean zero in this
 case (see the section on QML) .
 Even if this is the case, the individuals means can be calculated by simulation
, so it is always possible to consistently estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{I}(\lambda^{0})$
\end_inset

 when the model is simulable.
 On the other hand, if the score generator is taken to be correctly specified,
 the ordinary estimator of the information matrix is consistent.
 Combining this with the result on the efficient GMM

 implies that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n\bar{m}_{n}(\hat{\theta},\hat{\lambda})^{\prime}\left[\left(1+\frac{1}{H}\right)\mathcal{I}(\hat{\lambda})\right]^{-1}\bar{m}_{n}(\hat{\theta},\hat{\lambda})\stackrel{a}{\sim}\chi^{2}(q)

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $q$

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\dim(\lambda)-\dim(\theta),$
\end_inset

 since without 
\begin_inset Formula $\dim(\theta)$

 moment conditions the model is not identified, so testing is impossible.
 One test of the model is simply based on this statistic: if it exceeds
 the

\end_inset

 critical point, something may be wrong (the small sample performance of
 this sort of test would be a topic worth investigating).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Information about what is wrong can be gotten from the pseudo-t-statistics:

\end_inset

 can be used to test which moments are not well modeled.
 Since these moments are related to parameters of the score generator, which
 are usually related to certain features of the model, this information
 can be used to revise the model.
 These aren't actually distributed as 
\begin_inset Formula $N(0,1),$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}\bar{m}_{n}(\theta^{0},\hat{\lambda})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}\bar{m}_{n}(\hat{\theta},\hat{\lambda})$
\end_inset

 have different distributions (that of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}\bar{m}_{n}(\hat{\theta},\hat{\lambda})$
\end_inset

 is somewhat more complicated).
 It can be shown that the pseudo-t statistics are biased toward nonrejection.

\begin_layout Standard
Parallel computing can offer an important reduction in the time to complete
 computations.
 This is well-known, but it bears emphasis since it is the main reason that
 parallel computing may be attractive to users.
 To illustrate, the Intel Pentium IV (Willamette) processor, running at
 1.5GHz, was introduced in November of 2000.
 The Pentium IV (Northwood-HT) processor, running at 3.06GHz, was introduced
 in November of 2002.
 An approximate doubling of the performance of a commodity CPU took place
 in two years.
 Extrapolating this admittedly rough snapshot of the evolution of the performanc
e of commodity processors, one would need to wait more than 6.6 years and
 then purchase a new computer to obtain a 10-fold improvement in computational
 performance.
 The examples in this chapter show that a 10-fold improvement in performance
 can be achieved immediately, using distributed parallel computing on available
 computers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recent (this is written in 2005) developments that may make parallel computing
 attractive to a broader spectrum of researchers who do computations.
 The first is the fact that setting up a cluster of computers for distributed
 parallel computing is not difficult.

 A third is the spread of dual and quad-core CPUs, so that an ordinary desktop

 A focus of the examples is on the possibility of hiding parallelization
 from end users of programs.
 If programs that run in parallel have an interface that is nearly identical
 to the interface of equivalent serial versions, end users will find it
 easy to take advantage of parallel computing's performance.

A Monte Carlo study involves repeating a random experiment many times under

 Several authors have noted that Monte Carlo studies are obvious candidates
 for parallelization (Doornik

 on different computers.

 is a function that calculates the trace test statistic for the lack of
 cointegration of integrated time series.
 This function is illustrative of the format that we adopt for Monte Carlo
 simulation of a function: it receives a single argument of cell type, and
 it returns a row vector that holds the results of one random simulation.
 The single argument in this case is a cell array that holds the length
 of the series in its first position, and the number of series in the second
 position.
 It generates a random result though a process that is internal to the function,
 and it reports some output in a row vector (in this case the result is
 a scalar).

\begin_inset Formula

where
\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$

 may be a vector of random variables, and the model may be dynamic since
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 may contain lags of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 As Swann (2002) points out, this can be broken into sums over blocks of
 observations, for example two blocks:
\begin_inset Formula

Analogously, we can define up to

For a sample as above, the GMM estimator of the parameter

 can be defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

where

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\bar{m}_{n}(\theta)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}m_{t}(y_{t}|x_{t},\theta)
\]

\end_inset

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{m}_{n}(\theta)$
\end_inset

 is an average, it can obviously be computed blockwise, using for example
 2 blocks:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\bar{m}_{n}(\theta)=\frac{1}{n}\left\{ \left(\sum_{t=1}^{n_{1}}m_{t}(y_{t}|x_{t},\theta)\right)+\left(\sum_{t=n_{1}+1}^{n}m_{t}(y_{t}|x_{t},\theta)\right)\right\} \label{eq:gmm moment contributions}

 When this is run,

 The point to notice here is that an end user can perform the estimation

 Again, 
\family typewriter
gmm_estimate
\family default
, used in lines 8 and 10, is a generic function that will estimate any model
 specified by the 
\family typewriter
moments
\family default
 variable - a different model can be estimated by changing the value of
 the

moments
\family default
 variable.
 The function that 
\family typewriter
moments
\family default
 points to is an ordinary Octave function that uses no parallel programming,
 so users can write their models using the simple and intuitive HLMP syntax
 of Octave.
 Whether estimation is done in parallel or serially depends only the seventh
 argument to

\family default
 - when it is missing or zero, estimation is by default done serially with
 one processor.

 Racine (2002) demonstrates that MPI parallelization can be used to speed
 up calculation of the kernel regression estimator by calculating the fits
 for portions of the sample on different computers.
 We follow this implementation here.

 Serial execution is obtained by setting the number of slaves equal to zero,
 in line 15.
 In line 17, a single slave is specified, so execution is in parallel on
 the master and slave nodes.

The example programs show that parallelization may be mostly hidden from
 end users.
 Users can benefit from parallelization without having to write or understand
 parallel code.
 The speedups one can obtain are highly dependent upon the specific problem
 at hand, as well as the size of the cluster, the efficiency of the network,
 
\emph on
etc.

\emph default
 Some examples of speedups are presented in Creel (2005).
 Figure

 reproduces speedups for some econometric problems on a cluster of 12 desktop
 computers.
 The speedup for 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 nodes is the time to finish the problem on a single node divided by the
 time to finish the problem on 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 nodes.
 Note that you can get 10X speedups, as claimed in the introduction.
 It's pretty obvious that much greater speedups could be obtained using
 a larger cluster, for the

Duration data and the Weibull model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some cases the dependent variable may be the time that passes between
 the occurrence of two events.
 For example, it may be the duration of a strike, or the time needed to
 find a job once one is unemployed.
 Such variables take on values on the positive real line, and are referred
 to as duration data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\emph on
spell
\emph default
 is the period of time between the occurrence of initial event and the concludin
g event.
 For example, the initial event could be the loss of a job, and the final
 event is the finding of a new job.
 The spell is the period of unemployment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}$
\end_inset

 be the time the initial event occurs, and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}$
\end_inset

 be the time the concluding event occurs.
 For simplicity, assume that time is measured in years.
 The random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is the duration of the spell, 
\begin_inset Formula $D=t_{1}-t_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Define the density function of 
\begin_inset Formula $D,$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{D}(t),$
\end_inset

 with distribution function 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{D}(t)=\Pr(D<t).$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several questions may be of interest.
 For example, one might wish to know the expected time one has to wait to
 find a job given that one has already waited 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 years.
 The probability that a spell lasts more than 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 years is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Pr(D>s)=1-\Pr(D\leq s)=1-F_{D}(s).
\]

\end_inset

 The density of 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 conditional on the spell being longer than 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 years is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{D}(t|D>s)=\frac{f_{D}(t)}{1-F_{D}(s)}.
\]

\end_inset

 The expected additional time required for the spell to end given that is
 has already lasted 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 years is the expectation of 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 with respect to this density, minus 
\begin_inset Formula $s.$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E=\mathcal{E}(D|D>s)-s=\left(\int_{t}^{\infty}z\frac{f_{D}(z)}{1-F_{D}(s)}dz\right)-s
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To estimate this function, one needs to specify the density 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{D}(t)$
\end_inset

 as a parametric density, then estimate by maximum likelihood.
 There are a number of possibilities including the exponential density,
 the lognormal, 
\emph on
etc.

\emph default
 A reasonably flexible model that is a generalization of the exponential
 density is the Weibull density
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{D}(t|\theta)=e^{-\left(\lambda t\right)^{\gamma}}\lambda\gamma(\lambda t)^{\gamma-1}.
\]

\end_inset

 According to this model, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}(D)=\lambda^{-\gamma}.$
\end_inset

 The log-likelihood is just the product of the log densities.
\end_layout

To illustrate application of this model, 402 observations on the lifespan

 The

\begin_inset Quotes srd

 in this case is the lifetime of an individual mongoose.
 The parameter estimates and standard errors are 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\lambda}=0.559\,(0.034)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\gamma}=0.867\,(0.033)$

 The plot is accompanied by a nonparametric Kaplan-Meier estimate of life-expect

In the figure one can see that the model doesn't fit the data well, in that
 it predicts life expectancy quite differently than does the nonparametric
 model.
 For ages 4-6, the nonparametric estimate is outside the confidence interval
 that results from the parametric model, which casts doubt upon the parametric
 model.
 Mongooses that are between 2-6 years old seem to have a lower life expectancy
 than is predicted by the Weibull model, whereas young mongooses that survive
 beyond infancy have a higher life expectancy, up to a bit beyond 2 years.
 Due to the dramatic change in the death rate as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, one might specify 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{D}(t)$
\end_inset

 as a mixture of two Weibull densities, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{D}(t|\theta)=\delta\left(e^{-\left(\lambda_{1}t\right)^{\gamma_{1}}}\lambda_{1}\gamma_{1}(\lambda_{1}t)^{\gamma_{1}-1}\right)+\left(1-\delta\right)\left(e^{-\left(\lambda_{2}t\right)^{\gamma_{2}}}\lambda_{2}\gamma_{2}(\lambda_{2}t)^{\gamma_{2}-1}\right).
\]

\end_inset

 The parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i},i=1,2$
\end_inset

 are the parameters of the two Weibull densities, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the parameter that mixes the two.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the same data, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 can be estimated using the mixed model.
 The results are a log-likelihood = -623.17.
 Note that a standard likelihood ratio test cannot be used to chose between
 the two models, since under the null that 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=1$
\end_inset

 (single density), the two parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{2}$
\end_inset

 are not identified.
 It is possible to take this into account, but this topic is out of the
 scope of this course.
 Nevertheless, the improvement in the likelihood function is considerable.

 That is, it's not necessary to subtract the individual means, since they

Nonlinear simultaneous equations

 GMM provides a convenient way to estimate nonlinear systems of simultaneous
 equations.
 We have a system of equations of the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{1t} & = & f_{1}(\mathbf{z}_{t},\theta_{1}^{0})+\varepsilon_{1t}\\
y_{2t} & = & f_{2}(\mathbf{z}_{t},\theta_{2}^{0})+\varepsilon_{2t}\\

y_{Gt} & = & f_{G}(\mathbf{z}_{t},\theta_{G}^{0})+\varepsilon_{Gt},

\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $f(\cdot)$

 -vector valued function, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{0}=(\theta_{1}^{0\prime},\theta_{2}^{0\prime},\cdots,\theta_{G}^{0\prime})^{\prime}.$
\end_inset

 We assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{z}_{t}$
\end_inset

 contains the current period endogenous variables, so we have a simultaneity
 problem.

 vector of instruments

\end_inset

 Typical instruments would be low order monomials in the exogenous variables
 in

To begin with, define the lag operator 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Ly_{t}=y_{t-1}
\]

\end_inset

 The lag operator is defined to behave just as an algebraic quantity, e.g.,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
L^{2}y_{t} & =L(Ly_{t})\\
 & =Ly_{t-1}\\
 & =y_{t-2}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
(1-L)(1+L)y_{t} & = & 1-Ly_{t}+Ly_{t}-L^{2}y_{t}\\
 & = & 1-y_{t-2}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A mean-zero AR(p) process can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}-\phi_{1}y_{t-1}-\phi_{2}y_{t-2}-\cdots-\phi_{p}y_{t-p}=\varepsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}(1-\phi_{1}L-\phi_{2}L^{2}-\cdots-\phi_{p}L^{p})=\varepsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 Factor this polynomial as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1-\phi_{1}L-\phi_{2}L^{2}-\cdots-\phi_{p}L^{p}=(1-\lambda_{1}L)(1-\lambda_{2}L)\cdots(1-\lambda_{p}L)
\]

\end_inset

 For the moment, just assume that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 are coefficients to be determined.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $L\;$
\end_inset

is defined to operate as an algebraic quantity, determination of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the same as determination of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 such that the following two expressions are the same for all 
\begin_inset Formula $z:$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1-\phi_{1}z-\phi_{2}z^{2}-\cdots-\phi_{p}z^{p}=(1-\lambda_{1}z)(1-\lambda_{2}z)\cdots(1-\lambda_{p}z)
\]

\end_inset

 Multiply both sides by 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{-p}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
z^{-p}-\phi_{1}z^{1-p}-\phi_{2}z^{2-p}-\cdots\phi_{p-1}z^{-1}-\phi_{p}=(z^{-1}-\lambda_{1})(z^{-1}-\lambda_{2})\cdots(z^{-1}-\lambda_{p})
\]

\end_inset

 and now define 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=z^{-1}$
\end_inset

 so we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda^{p}-\phi_{1}\lambda^{p-1}-\phi_{2}\lambda^{p-2}-\cdots-\phi_{p-1}\lambda-\phi_{p}=(\lambda-\lambda_{1})(\lambda-\lambda_{2})\cdots(\lambda-\lambda_{p})
\]

\end_inset

 The LHS is precisely the determinantal polynomial that gives the eigenvalues
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $F.$
\end_inset

 Therefore, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 that are the coefficients of the factorization are simply the eigenvalues
 of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $F.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now consider a different stationary process 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(1-\phi L)y_{t}=\varepsilon_{t}

\begin_layout Itemize
Stationarity, as above, implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $|\phi|<1.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multiply both sides by 
\begin_inset Formula $1+\phi L+\phi^{2}L^{2}+...+\phi^{j}L^{j}$
\end_inset

 to get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(1+\phi L+\phi^{2}L^{2}+...+\phi^{j}L^{j}\right)(1-\phi L)y_{t}=\left(1+\phi L+\phi^{2}L^{2}+...+\phi^{j}L^{j}\right)\varepsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 or, multiplying the polynomials on the LHS, we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(1+\phi L+\phi^{2}L^{2}+...+\phi^{j}L^{j}-\phi L-\phi^{2}L^{2}-...-\phi^{j}L^{j}-\phi^{j+1}L^{j+1}\right)y_{t}=\left(1+\phi L+\phi^{2}L^{2}+...+\phi^{j}L^{j}\right)\varepsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset

and with cancellations we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(1-\phi^{j+1}L^{j+1}\right)y_{t}=\left(1+\phi L+\phi^{2}L^{2}+...+\phi^{j}L^{j}\right)\varepsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=\phi^{j+1}L^{j+1}y_{t}+\left(1+\phi L+\phi^{2}L^{2}+...+\phi^{j}L^{j}\right)\varepsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 Now as 
\begin_inset Formula $j\rightarrow\infty,$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi^{j+1}L^{j+1}y_{t}\rightarrow0,$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $|\phi|<1,$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}\cong\left(1+\phi L+\phi^{2}L^{2}+...+\phi^{j}L^{j}\right)\varepsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 and the approximation becomes better and better as 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 increases.
 However, we started with 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(1-\phi L)y_{t}=\varepsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 Substituting this into the above equation we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}\cong\left(1+\phi L+\phi^{2}L^{2}+...+\phi^{j}L^{j}\right)(1-\phi L)y_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(1+\phi L+\phi^{2}L^{2}+...+\phi^{j}L^{j}\right)(1-\phi L)\cong1
\]

\end_inset

 and the approximation becomes arbitrarily good as 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 increases arbitrarily.
 Therefore, for 
\begin_inset Formula $|\phi|<1,$
\end_inset

 define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(1-\phi L)^{-1}=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\phi^{j}L^{j}
\]

\end_inset

 Recall that our mean zero AR(p) process 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}(1-\phi_{1}L-\phi_{2}L^{2}-\cdots-\phi_{p}L^{p})=\varepsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 can be written using the factorization 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}(1-\lambda_{1}L)(1-\lambda_{2}L)\cdots(1-\lambda_{p}L)=\varepsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 are the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $F,$
\end_inset

 and given stationarity, all the 
\begin_inset Formula $|\lambda_{i}|<1.$
\end_inset

 Therefore, we can invert each first order polynomial on the LHS to get
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=\left(\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\lambda_{1}^{j}L^{j}\right)\left(\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\lambda_{2}^{j}L^{j}\right)\cdots\left(\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\lambda_{p}^{j}L^{j}\right)\varepsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 The RHS is a product of infinite-order polynomials in 
\begin_inset Formula $L,$
\end_inset

 which can be represented as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=(1+\psi_{1}L+\psi_{2}L^{2}+\cdots)\varepsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}$

 then so is 
\begin_inset Formula $a-bi.$

\left(a+bi\right)(a-bi) & = & a^{2}-abi+abi-b^{2}i^{2}\\

Invertibility of MA(q) process

\begin_layout Standard
An MA(q) can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}-\mu=(1+\theta_{1}L+...+\theta_{q}L^{q})\varepsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 As before, the polynomial on the RHS can be factored as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(1+\theta_{1}L+...+\theta_{q}L^{q})=(1-\eta_{1}L)(1-\eta_{2}L)...(1-\eta_{q}L)
\]

\end_inset

 and each of the 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\eta_{i}L)$
\end_inset

 can be inverted as long as each of the 
\begin_inset Formula $|\eta_{i}|<1.$
\end_inset

 If this is the case, then we can write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(1+\theta_{1}L+...+\theta_{q}L^{q})^{-1}(y_{t}-\mu)=\varepsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(1+\theta_{1}L+...+\theta_{q}L^{q})^{-1}
\]

\end_inset

 will be an infinite-order polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $L,$
\end_inset

 so we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}-\delta_{j}L^{j}(y_{t-j}-\mu)=\varepsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{0}=-1,$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(y_{t}-\mu)-\delta_{1}(y_{t-1}-\mu)-\delta_{2}(y_{t-2}-\mu)+...=\varepsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=c+\delta_{1}y_{t-1}+\delta_{2}y_{t-2}+...+\varepsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c=\mu+\delta_{1}\mu+\delta_{2}\mu+...

\end_inset

 So we see that an MA(q)

has an infinite AR representation, as long as the

\begin_inset Formula $i=1,2,...,q.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It turns out that one can always manipulate the parameters of an MA(q) process
 to find an invertible representation.
 For example, the two MA(1) processes 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}-\mu=(1-\theta L)\varepsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}^{\ast}-\mu=(1-\theta^{-1}L)\varepsilon_{t}^{\ast}
\]

\end_inset

 have exactly the same moments if 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma_{\varepsilon^{\ast}}^{2}=\sigma_{\varepsilon}^{2}\theta^{2}
\]

\end_inset

 For example, we've seen that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma_{0}=\sigma^{2}(1+\theta^{2}).
\]

\end_inset

 Given the above relationships amongst the parameters, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma_{0}^{\ast}=\sigma_{\varepsilon}^{2}\theta^{2}(1+\theta^{-2})=\sigma^{2}(1+\theta^{2})
\]

\end_inset

 so the variances are the same.
 It turns out that 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 the autocovariances will be the same, as is easily checked.
 This means that the two MA processes are 
\emph on
observationally equivalent
\emph default

 As before, it's impossible to distinguish between observationally equivalent
 processes on the basis of data.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It's important to find an invertible representation, since it's the only

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Why is invertibility important? The most important reason is that it provides
 a justification for the use of parsimonious models.
 Since an AR(1) process has an MA(

 representation, one can reverse the argument and note that at least some
 MA(
\begin_inset Formula $\infty)$
\end_inset

 processes have an AR(1)

representation.
 Likewise, some AR(
\begin_inset Formula $\infty)$
\end_inset

 processes have an MA(1) representation.
 At the time of estimation, it's a lot easier to estimate the single AR(1)
 or MA(1) coefficient rather than the infinite number of coefficients associated

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D_{n}(\theta)=\frac{1}{n}H_{n}Z_{n}.
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{n}$

 its columns.
 Likewise, define the var-cov.
 of the moment conditions 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Omega_{n} & = & \mathcal{E}\left[n\bar{m}_{n}(\theta^{0})\bar{m}_{n}(\theta^{0})^{\prime}\right]\\
 & = & \mathcal{E}\left[\frac{1}{n}Z_{n}^{\prime}h_{n}(\theta^{0})h_{n}(\theta^{0})^{\prime}Z_{n}\right]\\
 & = & Z_{n}^{\prime}\mathcal{E}\left(\frac{1}{n}h_{n}(\theta^{0})h_{n}(\theta^{0})^{\prime}\right)Z_{n}\\
 & \equiv & Z_{n}^{\prime}\frac{\Phi_{n}}{n}Z_{n}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where we have defined 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{n}=V\left(h_{n}(\theta^{0})\right).$
\end_inset

 Note that the dimension of this matrix is growing with the sample size,
 so it is not consistently estimable without additional assumptions.

The asymptotic normality theorem above says that the GMM

estimator using the optimal weighting matrix is distributed as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\theta}-\theta^{0}\right)\stackrel{d}{\rightarrow}N(0,V_{\infty})
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V_{\infty}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\left(\frac{H_{n}Z_{n}}{n}\right)\left(\frac{Z_{n}^{\prime}\Phi_{n}Z_{n}}{n}\right)^{-1}\left(\frac{Z_{n}^{\prime}H_{n}^{\prime}}{n}\right)\right)^{-1}.\label{var-covcondmoments,nonoptimal}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Using an argument similar to that used to prove that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{\infty}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is the efficient weighting matrix, we can show that putting 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z_{n}=\Phi_{n}^{-1}H_{n}^{\prime}
\]

\end_inset

 causes the above var-cov matrix to simplify to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V_{\infty}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\frac{H_{n}\Phi_{n}^{-1}H_{n}^{\prime}}{n}\right)^{-1}.\label{simplevarcov,condmoments}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and furthermore, this matrix is smaller that the limiting var-cov for any
 other choice of instrumental variables.
 (To prove this, examine the difference of the inverses of the var-cov matrices
 with the optimal intruments and with non-optimal instruments.
 As above, you can show that the difference is positive semi-definite).

Note that both

\end_inset

 which we should write more properly as 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{n}(\theta^{0}),$
\end_inset

 since it depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{0},$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

 must be consistently estimated to apply this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Usually, estimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{n}$
\end_inset

 is straightforward - one just uses 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{H}=\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}h_{n}^{\prime}\left(\tilde{\theta}\right),
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\theta}$
\end_inset

 is some initial consistent estimator based on non-optimal instruments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Estimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{n}$
\end_inset

 may not be possible.
 It is an 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix, so it has more unique elements than 
\begin_inset Formula $n,$
\end_inset

 the sample size, so without restrictions on the parameters it can't be
 estimated consistently.
 Basically, you need to provide a parametric specification of the covariances
 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{t}(\theta)\;$
\end_inset

in order to be able to use optimal instruments.
 A solution is to approximate this matrix parametrically to define the instrumen
ts.
 Note that the simplified var-cov matrix in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "simplevarcov,condmoments"

\end_inset

 will not apply if approximately optimal instruments are used - it will
 be necessary to use an estimator based upon equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "var-covcondmoments,nonoptimal"

\end_inset

, where the term 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-1}Z_{n}^{\prime}\Phi_{n}Z_{n}$
\end_inset

 must be estimated consistently apart, for example by the Newey-West procedure.

We see that for the OBDV measure, there are many more actual zeros than
 predicted.
 For ERV, there are somewhat more actual zeros than fitted, but the difference
 is not too important.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why might OBDV not fit the zeros well? What if people made the decision
 to contact the doctor for a first visit, they are sick, then the 
\emph on
doctor
\emph default
 decides on whether or not follow-up visits are needed.
 This is a principal/agent type situation, where the total number of visits
 depends upon the decision of both the patient and the doctor.
 Since different parameters may govern the two decision-makers choices,
 we might expect that different parameters govern the probability of zeros
 versus the other counts.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{p}$
\end_inset

 be the parameters of the patient's demand for visits, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{d}$
\end_inset

 be the paramter of the doctor's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

demand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for visits.
 The patient will initiate visits according to a discrete choice model,
 for example, a logit model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Pr(Y=0) & =f_{Y}(0,\lambda_{p})= & 1-1/\left[1+\exp(-\lambda_{p})\right]\\
\Pr(Y>0) & = & 1/\left[1+\exp(-\lambda_{p})\right],
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 The above probabilities are used to estimate the binary 0/1 hurdle process.
 Then, for the observations where visits are positive, a truncated Poisson
 density is estimated.
 This density is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
f_{Y}(y,\lambda_{d}|y>0) & = & \frac{f_{Y}(y,\lambda_{d})}{\Pr(y>0)}\\
 & = & \frac{f_{Y}(y,\lambda_{d})}{1-\exp(-\lambda_{d})}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

since according to the Poisson model with the doctor's paramaters,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Pr(y=0)=\frac{\exp(-\lambda_{d})\lambda_{d}^{0}}{0!}.
\]

\end_inset

Since the hurdle and truncated components of the overall density for 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 share no parameters, they may be estimated separately, which is computationally
 more efficient than estimating the overall model.
 (Recall that the BFGS algorithm, for example, will have to invert the approxima
ted Hessian.
 The computational overhead is of order 
\begin_inset Formula $K^{2}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 is the number of parameters to be estimated) .
 The expectation of 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
E(Y|x) & = & \Pr(Y>0|x)E(Y|Y>0,x)\\
 & = & \left(\frac{1}{1+\exp(-\lambda_{p})}\right)\left(\frac{\lambda_{d}}{1-\exp(-\lambda_{d})}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

For the Hurdle Poisson models, the ERV fit is very accurate.
 The OBDV fit is not so good.
 Zeros are exact, but 1's and 2's are underestimated, and higher counts
 are overestimated.
 For the NB-II fits, performance is at least as good as the hurdle Poisson
 model, and one should recall that many fewer parameters are used.
 Hurdle version of the negative binomial model are also widely used.

The 95% confidence interval for the mix parameter is perilously close to
 1, which suggests that there may really be only one component density,
 rather than a mixture.
 Again, this is

Education is interesting.
 For the subpopulation that is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

healthy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, i.e., that makes relatively few visits, education seems to have a positive
 effect on visits.
 For the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 group, education has a negative effect on visits.
 The other results are more mixed.
 A larger sample could help clarify things.

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction and definition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nonlinear least squares (NLS) is a means of estimating the parameter of
 the model 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=f(\mathbf{x}_{t},\theta^{0})+\varepsilon_{t}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In general, 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 will be heteroscedastic and autocorrelated, and possibly nonnormally distribute
d.
 However, dealing with this is exactly as in the case of linear models,
 so we'll just treat the iid case here, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varepsilon_{t}\sim iid(0,\sigma^{2})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we stack the observations vertically, defining 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{y}=(y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{n})^{\prime}
\]

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{f}=(f(x_{1},\theta),f(x_{1},\theta),...,f(x_{1},\theta))^{\prime}
\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varepsilon=(\varepsilon_{1},\varepsilon_{2},...,\varepsilon_{n})^{\prime}
\]

\end_inset

 we can write the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 observations as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{f}(\theta)+\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset

 Using this notation, the NLS estimator can be defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\theta}\equiv\arg\min_{\Theta}s_{n}(\theta)=\frac{1}{n}\left[\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{f}(\theta)\right]^{\prime}\left[\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{f}(\theta)\right]=\frac{1}{n}\parallel\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{f}(\theta)\parallel^{2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The estimator minimizes the weighted sum of squared errors, which is the
 same as minimizing the Euclidean distance between 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}(\theta).$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective function can be written as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{n}(\theta)=\frac{1}{n}\left[\mathbf{y}^{\prime}\mathbf{y}-2\mathbf{y}^{\prime}\mathbf{f}(\theta)+\mathbf{f}(\theta)^{\prime}\mathbf{f}(\theta)\right],
\]

\end_inset

 which gives the first order conditions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\mathbf{f}(\hat{\theta})^{\prime}\right]\mathbf{y}+\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\mathbf{f}(\hat{\theta})^{\prime}\right]\mathbf{f}(\hat{\theta})\equiv0.
\]

\end_inset

 Define the 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times K$
\end_inset

 matrix 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F}(\hat{\theta})\equiv D_{\theta^{\prime}}\mathbf{f}(\hat{\theta}).\label{nlsderiv}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 In shorthand, use 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mathbf{F}}$
\end_inset

 in place of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}(\hat{\theta}).$
\end_inset

 Using this, the first order conditions can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-\hat{\mathbf{F}}^{\prime}\mathbf{y}+\hat{\mathbf{F}}^{\prime}\mathbf{f}(\hat{\theta})\equiv0,
\]

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{F}}^{\prime}\left[\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{f}(\hat{\theta})\right]\equiv0.\label{nlsfoc}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 This bears a good deal of similarity to the f.o.c.
 for the linear model - the derivative of the prediction is orthogonal to
 the prediction error.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}(\theta)=\mathbf{X}\theta,$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mathbf{F}}$
\end_inset

 is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X},$
\end_inset

 so the f.o.c.
 (with spherical errors)

\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}(\theta)$

 is not necessarily well-behaved and may be difficult to minimize.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Identification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As before, identification can be considered conditional on the sample, and
 asymptotically.
 The condition for asymptotic identification is that 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}(\theta)$
\end_inset

 tend to a limiting function 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{\infty}(\theta)$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{\infty}(\theta^{0})<s_{\infty}(\theta),$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall\theta\neq\theta^{0}.$
\end_inset

 This will be the case if 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{\infty}(\theta^{0})$
\end_inset

 is strictly convex at 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{0},$
\end_inset

 which requires that 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\theta}^{2}s_{\infty}(\theta^{0})$
\end_inset

 be positive definite.
 Consider the objective function: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
s_{n}(\theta) & = & \frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left[y_{t}-f(\mathbf{x}_{t},\theta)\right]^{2}\\
 & = & \frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left[f(\mathbf{x}_{t},\theta^{0})+\varepsilon_{t}-f_{t}(\mathbf{x}_{t},\theta)\right]^{2}\\
 & = & \frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left[f_{t}(\theta^{0})-f_{t}(\theta)\right]^{2}+\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left(\varepsilon_{t}\right)^{2}\\
 & - & \frac{2}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left[f_{t}(\theta^{0})-f_{t}(\theta)\right]\varepsilon_{t}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As in example 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eeolsexample"

\end_inset

, which illustrated the consistency of extremum estimators using OLS, we
 conclude that the second term will converge to a constant which does not
 depend upon 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A LLN can be applied to the third term to conclude that it converges pointwise
 to 0, as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}(\theta)\;$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 are uncorrelated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Next, pointwise convergence needs to be strengthened to uniform almost sure
 convergence.
 There are a number of possible assumptions one could use.
 Here, we'll just assume it holds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Turning to the first term, we'll assume a pointwise law of large numbers
 applies, so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left[f_{t}(\theta^{0})-f_{t}(\theta)\right]^{2}\stackrel{a.s.}{\rightarrow}\int\left[f(z,\theta^{0})-f(z,\theta)\right]^{2}d\mu(z),\label{nlslim}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(x)$
\end_inset

 is the distribution function of 
\begin_inset Formula $x.$
\end_inset

 In many cases, 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,\theta)$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
will
\emph default
 be bounded and continuous, for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\in\Theta,$
\end_inset

 so strengthening to uniform almost sure convergence is immediate.
 For example if 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,\theta)=\left[1+\exp(-x\theta)\right]^{-1},$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\Re^{K}\rightarrow\left(0,1\right),$
\end_inset

 a bounded range, and the function is continuous in 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given these results, it is clear that a minimizer is 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{0}.$
\end_inset

 When considering identification (asymptotic), the question is whether or
 not there may be some other minimizer.
 A local condition for identification is that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\theta\partial\theta^{\prime}}s_{\infty}(\theta)=\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\theta\partial\theta^{\prime}}\int\left[f(x,\theta^{0})-f(x,\theta)\right]^{2}d\mu(x)
\]

\end_inset

 be positive definite at 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{0}.$
\end_inset

 Evaluating this derivative, we obtain (after a little work)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left.\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\theta\partial\theta^{\prime}}\int\left[f(x,\theta^{0})-f(x,\theta)\right]^{2}d\mu(x)\right|_{\theta^{0}}=2\int\left[D_{\theta}f(z,\theta^{0})^{\prime}\right]\left[D_{\theta^{\prime}}f(z,\theta^{0})\right]^{\prime}d\mu(z)
\]

\end_inset

 the expectation of the outer product of the gradient of the regression
 function evaluated at 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{0}.$
\end_inset

 (Note:
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

the uniform boundedness we have already assumed allows passing the derivative
 through the integral, by the dominated convergence theorem.) This matrix
 will be positive definite (wp1) as long as the gradient vector is of full
 rank (wp1).
 The tangent space to the regression manifold must span a 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 -dimensional space if we are to consistently estimate a 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 -dimensional parameter vector.
 This is analogous to the requirement that there be no perfect colinearity
 in a linear model.
 This is a necessary condition for identification.
 Note that the LLN implies that the above expectation is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{J}_{\infty}(\theta^{0})=2\lim\mathcal{E}\frac{\mathbf{F}^{\prime}\mathbf{F}}{n}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Consistency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We simply assume that the conditions of Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Consistency of ee"

\end_inset

 hold, so the estimator is consistent.
 Given that the strong stochastic equicontinuity conditions hold, as discussed
 above, and given the above identification conditions an a compact estimation
 space (the closure of the parameter space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta),$
\end_inset

 the consistency proof's assumptions are satisfied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Asymptotic normality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As in the case of GMM, we also simply assume that the conditions for asymptotic
 normality as in Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Normality of ee"

\end_inset

 hold.
 The only remaining problem is to determine the form of the asymptotic variance-
covariance matrix.
 Recall that the result of the asymptotic normality theorem is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\theta}-\theta^{0}\right)\stackrel{d}{\rightarrow}N\left[0,\mathcal{J}_{\infty}(\theta^{0})^{-1}\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta^{0})\mathcal{J}_{\infty}(\theta^{0})^{-1}\right],
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{J}_{\infty}(\theta^{0})$
\end_inset

 is the almost sure limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\theta\partial\theta^{\prime}}s_{n}(\theta)$
\end_inset

 evaluated at 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{0},$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta^{0})=\lim Var\sqrt{n}D_{\theta}s_{n}(\theta^{0})
\]

\end_inset

 The objective function is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{n}(\theta)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left[y_{t}-f(\mathbf{x}_{t},\theta)\right]^{2}
\]

\end_inset

 So 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D_{\theta}s_{n}(\theta)=-\frac{2}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left[y_{t}-f(\mathbf{x}_{t},\theta)\right]D_{\theta}f(\mathbf{x}_{t},\theta).
\]

\end_inset

 Evaluating at 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{0},$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D_{\theta}s_{n}(\theta^{0})=-\frac{2}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\varepsilon_{t}D_{\theta}f(\mathbf{x}_{t},\theta^{0}).
\]

\end_inset

 Note that the expectation of this is zero, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{t}$
\end_inset

 are assumed to be uncorrelated.
 So to calculate the variance, we can simply calculate the second moment
 about zero.
 Also note that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{t=1}^{n}\varepsilon_{t}D_{\theta}f(\mathbf{x}_{t},\theta^{0}) & = & \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left[\mathbf{f}(\theta^{0})\right]^{\prime}\varepsilon\\
 & = & \mathbf{F}^{\prime}\varepsilon
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

With this we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta^{0}) & = & \lim Var\sqrt{n}D_{\theta}s_{n}(\theta^{0})\\
 & = & \lim n\mathcal{E}\frac{4}{n^{2}}\mathbf{F}^{\prime}\varepsilon\varepsilon^{\textrm{'}}\mathbf{F}\\
 & = & 4\sigma^{2}\lim\mathcal{E}\frac{\mathbf{F}^{\prime}\mathbf{F}}{n}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

We've already seen that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{J}_{\infty}(\theta^{0})=2\lim\mathcal{E}\frac{\mathbf{F}^{\prime}\mathbf{F}}{n},
\]

\end_inset

 where the expectation is with respect to the joint density of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon.$
\end_inset

 Combining these expressions for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{J}_{\infty}(\theta^{0})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{I}_{\infty}(\theta^{0}),$
\end_inset

 and the result of the asymptotic normality theorem, we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\theta}-\theta^{0}\right)\stackrel{d}{\rightarrow}N\left(0,\left(\lim\mathcal{E}\frac{\mathbf{F}^{\prime}\mathbf{F}}{n}\right)^{-1}\sigma^{2}\right).
\]

\end_inset

 We can consistently estimate the variance covariance matrix using 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{\hat{\mathbf{F}}^{\prime}\hat{\mathbf{F}}}{n}\right)^{-1}\hat{\sigma}^{2},\label{nlsvcov}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mathbf{F}}$
\end_inset

 is defined as in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\sigma}^{2}=\frac{\left[\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{f}(\hat{\theta})\right]^{\prime}\left[\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{f}(\hat{\theta})\right]}{n},
\]

\end_inset

 the obvious estimator.
 Note the close correspondence to the results for the linear model.

 This sort of model has been used to study visits to doctors per year, number

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Poisson density is 
\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

 The mean of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{t},$
\end_inset

 as is the variance.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{t}$
\end_inset

 must be positive.
 Suppose that the true mean is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda_{t}^{0}=\exp(\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\prime}\beta^{0}),
\]

\end_inset

 which enforces the positivity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{t}.$
\end_inset

 Suppose we estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{0}$
\end_inset

 by nonlinear least squares: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\beta}=\arg\min s_{n}(\beta)=\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left(y_{t}-\exp(\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\prime}\beta)\right)^{2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
s_{n}(\beta) & = & \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left(\exp(\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\prime}\beta^{0}+\varepsilon_{t}-\exp(\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\prime}\beta)\right)^{2}\\
 & = & \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left(\exp(\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\prime}\beta^{0}-\exp(\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\prime}\beta)\right)^{2}+\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\varepsilon_{t}^{2}+2\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\varepsilon_{t}\left(\exp(\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\prime}\beta^{0}-\exp(\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\prime}\beta)\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 The last term has expectation zero since the assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}(y_{t}|\mathbf{x}_{t})=\exp(\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\prime}\beta^{0})$
\end_inset

 implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}\left(\varepsilon_{t}|\mathbf{x}_{t}\right)=0,$
\end_inset

 which in turn implies that functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{t}$
\end_inset

 are uncorrelated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{t}.$
\end_inset

 Applying a strong LLN, and noting that the objective function is continuous
 on a compact parameter space, we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{\infty}(\beta)=\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{x}}\left(\exp(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\beta^{0}-\exp(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\beta)\right)^{2}+\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{x}}\exp(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\beta^{0})
\]

\end_inset

 where the last term comes from the fact that the conditional variance of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 is the same as the variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $y.$
\end_inset

 This function is clearly minimized at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\beta^{0},$

\begin_layout Standard
The Gauss-Newton optimization technique is specifically designed for nonlinear
 least squares.
 The idea is to linearize the nonlinear model, rather than the objective
 function.
 The model is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{f}(\theta^{0})+\varepsilon.
\]

\end_inset

 At some 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 in the parameter space, not equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{0},$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{f}(\theta)+\nu
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is a combination of the fundamental error term 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and the error due to evaluating the regression function at 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 rather than the true value 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{0}.$
\end_inset

 Take a first order Taylor's series approximation around a point 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{1}:$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{f}(\theta^{1})+\left[D_{\theta^{\prime}}\mathbf{f}\left(\theta^{1}\right)\right]\left(\theta-\theta^{1}\right)+\nu+\text{approximation error.}
\]

\end_inset

 Define 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{z}\equiv\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{f}(\theta^{1})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b\equiv(\theta-\theta^{1}).$
\end_inset

 Then the last equation can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{z}=\mathbf{F}(\theta^{1})b+\omega\text{,}
\]

\end_inset

 where, as above, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}(\theta^{1})\equiv D_{\theta^{\prime}}\mathbf{f}(\theta^{1})$

 is the

 Consider the example

\end_inset

 When evaluated at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{2}\approx0,$

Labor supply of a person is a positive number of hours per unit time supposing

\begin{eqnarray*}
w^{*} & = & \left(\mathbf{z}^{\prime}\gamma+\nu\right)-\left(\mathbf{q}^{\prime}\delta+\eta\right)\\

\end_inset

 We have the set of equations 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
s^{*} & = & \mathbf{x}^{\prime}\beta+\omega\\
w^{*} & = & \mathbf{r}^{\prime}\theta+\varepsilon.

\]

\end_inset

 We assume that the offer wage and the reservation wage, as well as the
 latent variable 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{*}$

 are unobservable.
 What is observed is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
w & = & 1\left[w^{*}>0\right]\\
s & = & ws^{*}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 In other words, we observe whether or not a person is working.
 If the person is working, we observe labor supply, which is equal to latent
 labor supply, 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{*}.$

 Otherwise, 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0\neq s^{*}.$
\end_inset

 Note that we are using a simplifying assumption that individuals can freely

 The problem is that these observations are those for which

 or equivalently, 
\begin_inset Formula $-\varepsilon<\mathbf{r}^{\prime}\theta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{E}\left[\omega|-\varepsilon<\mathbf{r}^{\prime}\theta\right]\neq0,

\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

 are dependent.
 Furthermore, this expectation will in general depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 since elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$

 can enter in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r}.$

 Because of these two facts, least squares estimation is biased and inconsistent.

 Given the joint normality of

 With this we can write 
\begin_inset Formula

 If we condition this equation on

To define a compact notation for partial derivatives, let 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$

 be an 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

-dimensional multi-index with no negative elements.
 Define 
\begin_inset Formula $\mid\lambda\mid^{*}$

 as the sum of the elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 If we have 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 arguments 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 of the (arbitrary) function 
\begin_inset Formula $h(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

, use 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{\lambda}h(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 to indicate a certain partial derivative: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D^{\lambda}h(\mathbf{x})\equiv\frac{\partial^{\mid\lambda\mid^{*}}}{\partial x_{1}^{\lambda_{1}}\partial x_{2}^{\lambda_{2}}\cdots\partial x_{N}^{\lambda_{N}}}h(\mathbf{x})

\end_inset

 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is the zero vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{\lambda}h(\mathbf{x})\equiv h(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

.
 Taking this definition and the last few equations into account, we see
 that it is possible to define 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1\times K\right)$

 vector 
\begin_inset Formula $Z^{\lambda}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 so that

\begin_layout Enumerate
A generic norm 
\begin_inset Formula $\parallel h\parallel$

 is used in place of the Euclidean norm.
 This norm may be stronger than the Euclidean norm, so that convergence
 with respect to

 implies convergence w.r.t the Euclidean norm.
 Typically we will want to make sure that the norm is strong enough to imply
 convergence of all functions of interest.

 It plays the role of the parameter space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta$
\end_inset

 in our discussion of parametric estimators.
 There is no restriction to a parametric family, only a restriction to a

 This formulation is much less restrictive than the restriction to a parametric

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There is a denseness assumption that was not present in the other theorem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will not prove this theorem (the proof is quite similar to the proof
 of theorem [
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Consistency of ee"

\end_inset

], see Gallant, 1987) but we will discuss its assumptions, in relation to
 the Fourier form as the approximating model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Sobolev norm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since all of the assumptions involve the norm 
\begin_inset Formula $\parallel h\parallel$
\end_inset

 , we need to make explicit what norm we wish to use.
 We need a norm that guarantees that the errors in approximation of the
 functions we are interested in are accounted for.
 Since we are interested in first-order elasticities in the present case,
 we need close approximation of both the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 and its first derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\prime}(x),$
\end_inset

 throughout the range of 
\begin_inset Formula $x.$
\end_inset

 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{X}$
\end_inset

 be an open set that contains all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 that we're interested in.
 The Sobolev norm is appropriate in this case.
 It is defined, making use of our notation for partial derivatives, as:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\parallel h\parallel_{m,\mathcal{X}}=\max_{\left|\lambda^{*}\right|\leq m}\sup_{\mathcal{X}}\left|D^{\lambda}h(x)\right|
\]

\end_inset

 To see whether or not the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 is well approximated by an approximating model 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{K}(x\mid\theta_{K})$
\end_inset

, we would evaluate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\parallel f(\mathbf{x})-g_{K}(\mathbf{x}\mid\theta_{K})\parallel_{m,\mathcal{X}}.
\]

\end_inset

 We see that this norm takes into account errors in approximating the function
 and partial derivatives up to order 
\begin_inset Formula $m.$
\end_inset

 If we want to estimate first order elasticities, as is the case in this
 example, the relevant 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 would be 
\begin_inset Formula $m=1.$
\end_inset

 Furthermore, since we examine the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sup$
\end_inset

 over 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{X},$
\end_inset

 convergence w.r.t.
 the Sobolev means 
\shape italic
uniform
\shape default
 convergence, so that we obtain consistent estimates for all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Compactness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verifying compactness with respect to this norm is quite technical and unenlight
ening.
 It is proven by Elbadawi, Gallant and Souza, 
\shape italic
Econometrica
\shape default
, 1983.
 The basic requirement is that if we need consistency w.r.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\parallel h\parallel_{m,\mathcal{X}},$
\end_inset

 then the functions of interest must belong to a Sobolev space which takes
 into account derivatives of order 
\begin_inset Formula $m+1$
\end_inset

.
 A Sobolev space is the set of functions 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{W}_{m,\mathcal{X}}(D)=\{h(\mathbf{x}):\parallel h(\mathbf{x})\parallel_{m,\mathcal{X}}<D\},
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is a finite constant.
 In plain words, the functions must have bounded partial derivatives of
 one order higher than the derivatives we seek to estimate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
The estimation space and the estimation subspace
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since in our case we're interested in consistent estimation of first-order
 elasticities, we'll define the estimation space as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
[Estimation space] The estimation space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{W}_{2,\mathcal{X}}(D).$
\end_inset

 The estimation space is an open set, and we presume that 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}\in\mathcal{H}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we are assuming that the function to be estimated has bounded second
 derivatives throughout 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{X}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With seminonparametric estimators, we don't actually optimize over the estimatio
n space.
 Rather, we optimize over a subspace, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{K_{n}},$
\end_inset

 defined as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
[Estimation subspace] The estimation subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{K}$
\end_inset

 is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{H}_{K}=\{g_{K}(\mathbf{x}|\theta_{K}):g_{K}(\mathbf{x}|\theta_{K})\in\mathcal{W}_{2,\mathcal{Z}}(D),\theta_{K}\in\Re^{K}\},
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{K}(\mathbf{x},\theta_{K})$
\end_inset

 is the Fourier form approximation as defined in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Denseness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The important point here is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{K}$
\end_inset

 is a space of functions that is indexed by a finite dimensional parameter
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{K}$
\end_inset

 has 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 elements, as in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "thetak"

\end_inset

).
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 observations, 
\begin_inset Formula $n>K,$
\end_inset

 this parameter is estimable.
 Note that the true function 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}$
\end_inset

 is not necessarily an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{K},$
\end_inset

 so optimization over 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{K}$
\end_inset

 may not lead to a consistent estimator.
 In order for optimization over 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{K}$
\end_inset

 to be equivalent to optimization over 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H},$
\end_inset

 at least asymptotically, we need that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The dimension of the parameter vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $\dim\theta_{K_{n}}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $n\rightarrow\infty.$
\end_inset

 This is achieved by making 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 increasing functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $n,$
\end_inset

 the sample size.
 It is clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 will have to grow more slowly than 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 The second requirement is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We need that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{K}$
\end_inset

 be dense subsets of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}.$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard

 is a dense subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\mathcal{H}}$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\parallel h\parallel_{1,\mathcal{X}},$
\end_inset

 it is useful to apply Theorem 1 of Gallant (1982), who in turn cites Edmunds
 and Moscatelli (1977).
 We reproduce the theorem as presented by Gallant, with minor notational
 changes, for convenience of reference:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
[Edmunds and Moscatelli, 1977] 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

Let the real-valued function 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 be continuously differentiable up to order 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 on an open set containing the closure of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{X}$
\end_inset

.
 Then it is possible to choose a triangular array of coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{1},\theta_{2},\ldots\theta_{K},\ldots,$
\end_inset

 such that for every 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq q<m$
\end_inset

, and every 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon>0,$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\parallel h^{*}(\mathbf{x})-h_{K}(\mathbf{x}|\theta_{K})\parallel_{q,\mathcal{X}}=o(K^{-m+q+\varepsilon})$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $K\rightarrow\infty.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the present application, 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $m=2$
\end_inset

.
 By definition of the estimation space, the elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 are once continuously differentiable on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{X}$
\end_inset

, which is open and contains the closure of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{X}$
\end_inset

, so the theorem is applicable.
 Closely following Gallant and Nychka (1987), 
\begin_inset Formula $\cup_{\infty}\mathcal{H}_{K}$
\end_inset

 is the countable union of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{K}$
\end_inset

.
 The implication of Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "EdMosctheorem"

\end_inset

 is that there is a sequence of {
\begin_inset Formula $h_{K}$
\end_inset

} from 
\begin_inset Formula $\cup_{\infty}\mathcal{H}_{K}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{K\rightarrow\infty}\parallel h^{*}-h_{K}\parallel_{1,\mathcal{X}}=0,
\]

\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}\in\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{H}\subset\overline{\cup_{\infty}\mathcal{H}_{K}}.
\]

\end_inset

However, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\cup_{\infty}\mathcal{H}_{K}\subset\mathcal{H},
\]

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\overline{\cup_{\infty}\mathcal{H}_{K}}\subset\overline{\mathcal{H}}.
\]

\end_inset

Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\overline{\mathcal{H}}=\overline{\cup_{\infty}\mathcal{H}_{K}},
\]

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $\cup_{\infty}\mathcal{H}_{K}$
\end_inset

 is a dense subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

, with respect to the norm 
\begin_inset Formula $\parallel h\parallel_{1,\mathcal{X}}$
\end_inset

 We estimate by OLS.
 The sample objective function stated in terms of maximization is

\]

\end_inset

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where the true function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 takes the place of the generic function 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}$
\end_inset

 in the presentation of the theorem.
 Both 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 are elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\cup_{\infty}\mathcal{H}_{K}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pointwise convergence of the objective function needs to be strengthened
 to uniform convergence.
 We will simply assume that this holds, since the way to verify this depends
 upon the specific application.
 We also have continuity of the objective function in 
\begin_inset Formula $g,$
\end_inset

 with respect to the norm 
\begin_inset Formula $\parallel h\parallel_{1,\mathcal{X}}$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
 &  & \lim_{\parallel g^{1}-g^{0}\parallel_{1,\mathcal{X}}\rightarrow0}\left\{ s_{\infty}\left(g^{1},f)\right)-s_{\infty}\left(g^{0},f)\right)\right\} \\
 & = & \lim_{\parallel g^{1}-g^{0}\parallel_{1,\mathcal{X}}\rightarrow0}\int_{\mathcal{X}}\left[\left(g^{1}(\mathbf{x})-f(\mathbf{x})\right)^{2}-\left(g^{0}(\mathbf{x})-f(\mathbf{x})\right)^{2}\right]d\mu x.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

By the dominated convergence theorem (which applies since the finite bound
 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 used to define 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{W}_{2,\mathcal{Z}}(D)$
\end_inset

 is dominated by an integrable function), the limit and the integral can
 be interchanged, so by inspection, the limit is zero.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Identification

The identification condition requires that for any point

\begin_inset Formula $s_{\infty}(g,f)\geq s_{\infty}(f,f)$

 This condition is clearly satisfied given that

\begin_layout Standard
Consistency requires that the number of parameters used in the expansion
 increase with the sample size, tending to infinity.
 If parameters are added at a high rate, the bias tends relatively rapidly
 to zero.
 A basic problem is that a high rate of inclusion of additional parameters
 causes the variance to tend more slowly to zero.
 The issue of how to chose the rate at which parameters are added and which
 to add first is fairly complex.
 A problem is that the allowable rates for asymptotic normality to obtain
 (Andrews 1991; Gallant and Souza, 1991) are very strict.
 Supposing we stick to these rates, our approximating model is: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g_{K}(\mathbf{x}|\theta_{K})=\mathbf{z}^{\prime}\theta_{K}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Define 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Z}_{K}$
\end_inset

 as the 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times K$
\end_inset

 matrix of regressors obtained by stacking observations.
 The LS estimator is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\theta}_{K}=\left(\mathbf{Z}_{K}^{\prime}\mathbf{Z}_{K}\right)^{+}\mathbf{Z}_{K}^{\prime}y,
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\cdot\right)^{+}$
\end_inset

 is the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse.

\begin_layout Itemize
This is used since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Z}_{K}^{\prime}\mathbf{Z}_{K}$
\end_inset

 may be singular, as would be the case for 
\begin_inset Formula $K(n)$
\end_inset

 large enough when some dummy variables are included.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper

.
 The prediction, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{z}^{\prime}\hat{\theta}_{K},$
\end_inset

 of the unknown function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 is asymptotically normally distributed: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{n}\left(\mathbf{z}^{\prime}\hat{\theta}_{K}-f(x)\right)\stackrel{d}{\rightarrow}N(0,AV),
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
AV=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}E\left[\mathbf{z}^{\prime}\left(\frac{\mathbf{Z}_{K}^{\prime}\mathbf{Z}_{K}}{n}\right)^{+}\mathbf{z}\hat{\sigma}^{2}\right].
\]

\end_inset

 Formally, this is exactly the same as if we were dealing with a parametric
 linear model.
 I emphasize, though, that this is only valid if 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 grows very slowly as 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 grows.
 If we can't stick to acceptable rates, we should probably use some other
 method of approximating the small sample distribution.
 Bootstrapping is a possibility.
 We'll discuss this in the section on simulation.
